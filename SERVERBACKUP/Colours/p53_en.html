                <p>August 2003. We're playing with a friend's eight year  old daughter. The young girl is drawing a rainbow and wants to use all the  colours of the spectrum, but she doesn't remember them. Before I tell her  anything she raises her hand to the light and focuses on her fingers. "I <em>see the colours on my fingers</em>", she  says. I ask her what exactly she sees. "<em>I  see the purple, red and yellow, blue and green, pink and orange</em>".</p>
                <p>She mentioned the mauve purple first. It was only natural,  since the whole room was full of mauve light. She can see all the colours. This  little one can see the aura. She bears a soul of blue aura.</p>
                <p>I remember not so long ago at work, when an associate  had brought her three year old daughter. "<em>Give  me a piece of paper so I can draw you</em>", she told me. She chose a pink colour from the  wooden paints box and drew a pink cloud. "<em>This  is you</em>", she told me. "<em>Are you sure</em>?"  I teased her. "<em>This is you</em>", she  insisted. I won't doubt you any more sweetie, because you can see.</p>
                <p>Most children can see the aura at an early age. Later  on they lose this ability, because their soul must get "grounded" and they must  work arduously as human beings here on Earth for their development. So we don't  continue any discussion with my friend's eight year old daughter about what she  is seeing. Whether we discuss it or not, as she grows older she will find her way if  she is to pass through this knowledge. Her parents bring her up with real care  and love, and that's what counts.</p>
                <p> Since I was a child              <u><a href="p08_en.html" class="la">I saw the Light of newborn souls</a></u>, particularly when I was just waking up in the morning in bed and was just opening my eyes, before &quot;returning&quot; altogether consciously to this world. This has never stopped, but only recently, since I have been seeing the aura consciously and with knowledge, have I understood what I saw.</p>
