                  11 July 2002. We are at the summer house. Suddenly the space is filled again with  the aroma of <u><a href="p43_en.html" class="la">incense</a></u>. I know by now that this experience is a salute  from Him, a reminder of His Existence. I'm thinking that when our consciousness  broadens it implies the broadening of all our senses as well. A few months  later I am home alone and this same aroma comes to me again. I feel moved. Many  times in the future He will salute us in this way.</p>
                <p>When I had almost finished writing "The Aura Diary" I mailed a copy to  my favourite painter. She had undertaken to paint the images of the aura. She  told me that as soon as she had opened the box, an aroma of incense overwhelmed  her. I know that it was a message of the Masters who watch over us and aid our  efforts.</p>
                <p>                  I'm reading my friend's book "<a href="../Kavafis/cover_en.htm" class="la">The Metaphysics in C.P. Cavafy</a>". I  focus my vision on the letter-press characters in order to see the light  emitted by the specific text. Suddenly, the letters are converted into a script  and a language totally unknown to me. Using a pencil I trace exactly  what I see. There is a lot of punctuation, or so it seems to me, which I note  with precision. After some time and investigation, we discovered that what I  saw was Aramaic, the ancient Hebrew language, in which Matthew the Evangelist  had indeed written his Gospel.</p>
                <p>In the image, we have depicted the aura exactly as it appears around the  letters in one of Cavafy's poems.</p>
                <p>Whenever I connect to the Light in order to see something new to me, the  space is filled with mauve Light.</p>
