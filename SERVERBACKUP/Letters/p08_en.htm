I realized that when fatigue debilitates you, the Mind is not able to  conceive. I realized that I do not have the right to think that every sign is  accidental. A body feeling like a wet rag needs time to return in order to see  ... to listen ... to endure ... I do not have the right to ignore something which is  the vessel for greater things. That's the message my body gave me and I  realized that this is more or less how one who loves you shows you "your  mistake".</p>

I exist where nobody is either afraid or worried ...  My body often betrays me but my inner condition, when I manage to go deep  within myself, is charged as if by an invisible charger and suddenly I regain the  strength that had abandoned me ...</span></div></td>
