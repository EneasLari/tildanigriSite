He was always on our path,  but we simply were not ready to accept Him ... Now everything seems natural, whereas in  the past we would have thought that something was wrong with our mental balance ...  So, do you see how methodically the truth is presented to human  beings? How can you not believe, how can you think that everything might be a  deception?<br>
              <br>
              The weather has softened, expectations  have mellowed, hope has taken on a colour! Our hearts are becoming increasingly larger,  and thus accommodate more people, becoming more and more pure and so, through their filter, they  purify whatever is desperately trying to infect them. Nothing is able to pull  them back! <br>

Just like us, too ... after endless mist and  storms, I think we have now reached the eternal Spring He promised us! <br>
