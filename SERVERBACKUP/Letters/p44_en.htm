Saturday afternoon, quiet and tender like the beginning of an  important day ... While I was thinking of going out for a while, I preferred my own  company, which is ultimately the best!<br>
          <br>
          All the noises of the day have abated and dusk is incredibly pretty, spring-like and sweet.  I have the luxury of observing everything, now that the mind has calmed down and can  think again of anything that makes it feel rested. </p>        </td>

            <p align="justify">Everything seems like yesterday and I  don't feel I have grown up ... and yet I don't miss them now ... I just think of  them, I long for them, I love them. I have  accepted their "absence"  perfectly and I am sure it's best for them. I have lit a candle and I send love with  its flame, I try to see their eyes separately so the light enters    their soul directly. I send them my love, that hasn't ended or been altered by time.  Somewhere, sometimes, I have the certainty of reciprocation ... other times they  seem distant ...</p>
            <div align="justify"><br>
          I am exceptionally "beloved" these days ... maybe some openly protect me ...  undisguised ... I feel like a child being caressed after much indifference ... so I'm  telling you, I live the grace of the universe with joy!</div></td>
