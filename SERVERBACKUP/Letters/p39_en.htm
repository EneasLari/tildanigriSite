Help, I was shouting to God, because I was alone and  could do so. I seemed like a lost child, broken by the ordeals ... My nerves were  in pieces, my resistance was at  breaking point, it wasn't easy to stop  crying. I hadn't cried that much for a very long time. God hears me, God sees  me, and the times are very few when I don't feel His eyes or hear His voice.  This was  one of those difficult moments ... it is over now ... it's gone.</div></td>

It's strange that I sensed danger  and I saw the whole carriage  disappearing! Does it remind me of my old capabilities? Does it bring the  message that appearance and disappearance are the same? By walking the path I  will sort it out ... </div></td>
