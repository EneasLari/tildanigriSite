    The place of future life selection is seen as a sphere containing highly concentrated force fields of glowing energy screens. People call this procedure scanning the timelines, and the more advanced tell me they can control the array of events in front of them with their minds. The sequence of events can, to some extent, be regulated in stop action for parts of a future life the soul may wish to consider more carefully.

    During viewing, the screens ebb and flow like a film of water. One woman used a suitable metaphor to represent her feelings about the experience when she said:<br><br>
"As the screens come alive they resemble a three-dimensional underwater aquarium. When I look at a life it's like taking a deep breath and going underwater. People, places, events-everything floats by you in a flash before your eyes as if you are drowning. Then you come back to the surface. When you are actually sampling a scene from the life they show you, it reflects the time a person is able to stay underwater."<br><br>

    This chapter contains one final soul specialty that I will add to my list. These are the Timemasters, who are coordinators engaged with past, present and future timelines of people and events. Timemasters are the highly adroit experts who give the impression of actually directing the presentations in our theater-in-the-round. These master souls are members of an entire fellowship of planners that include guides, Archivists and council Elders, who are involved with designing our future.

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> So I have heard. Why don't you tell me about number 2? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> (smiling) She is feminine and softer ... more flexible. She wants me to accept the body which will be pleasurable to be inside. She leans to moderation and turns to 1 and says there is plenty of time to learn my lessons. I have the feeling there is a deliberate juxtaposition between them for my benefit. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Sort of like the good cop, bad cop routine during an interrogation? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> (laughs) Yeah, maybe, so I will have an advocate in both camps with Fyum taking the middle road. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> So Fyum is kind of a referee? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> Mmm ... no, that's not true. Fyum is neither lenient nor severe in attitude as I deliberate my choices. It is made clear to me that the body choice is mine alone because I am going to have to live with it. (a burst of laughter) Hey, I made a pun! <br><br>

I could die quickly from a stray bullet during a gunfight between two drunken men. I could die more slowly after a fall from a bucking horse. And I could die by drowning in a river. <br><br>

    The reader may wonder about the connection of the laws of karma to future possibilities and probabilities. Karma does not only pertain to our deeds, it is internal as well, reflecting our thoughts, feelings and impulses-all relating to cause and effect. Karma is more than taking proper actions toward others, it is also having the intention to do so. While the timeline for the Amarillo woman had a high probability of being short, her early death was not chiselled in stone. One of the variables here was the type of soul that would occupy that particular body. Even with the soul who elected to take this body anticipating a short life, there were elements of free will to be considered. <br>

    I learned that it was not 100 percent ordained that this woman would die young by the stray bullet that hit her while she was standing across the street from the saloon where the gunfight took place. When I asked if she might have avoided going into Amarillo for supplies that day my, client said, "Yes, but something impelled me to go into town right when I did, and I almost didn't go without knowing why." Another soul might not have gone at the last minute without knowing why either.

    Although time has little relevance outside our physical universe, we see ourselves and everything around us aging each day. We live on a planet around a star, which is also constantly aging in chronological time. The cycle of life involves movement of time and the timelines of our dimensional reality appear to be influenced by advanced beings who allow reincarnating souls to study the past and see into the future. In libraries and spiritual learning centers we can view other possible actions we might have taken in former lives to explore the "what ifs" of our past. In our universe, when the past is over, these events and the people involved with them become eternal and are forever preserved in spiritual libraries.

    The planners deal in the "what ifs" of our lives. Events which have not yet taken place in the grand scheme of things are known by Timemasters and others for their greater or lesser potential of happening. We do not simply study alternate timelines of future events in the Ring. Rather, we examine the alternative bodies offered us that will exist within those events. These bodies will be born into roughly the same time frames. Watching the most probable series of events linked to those bodies under consideration is like previewing advance promotional scenes from a movie. <br>

    One thing I have noticed in the selection of bodies is that the more advanced souls are able, to make insightful comparisons between the bodies offered them within the time periods that are presented. I also see many less-advanced souls accept the body they know they ought to choose as the best course of action. They trust the selection process more than themselves. A client said, "For me, getting a new body is like trying on a new suit of clothes off the rack which you want to buy and hope it won't need alterations."

    For instance, the Archivist Souls assist souls in searching out their past histories and alternative timelines to those events. Thus, they function more as historians and chroniclers than as Timemasters who would track timelines of the immediate future for bodies under consideration in the life selection room. As with the other soul specialties, I'm sure there is overlapping here, too, with many masters working on time coordination for souls in need of their services. This is why my clients often lump them all together in their minds with the label of planners.

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> That's all right, Obidom. I would like to discuss where you are now working, who teaches you, and something about the practical art of becoming a Timemaster. <br><Br>
    <strong>S:</strong> (quietly) Time training is conducted at a temple, (grins) We call it the Temple of Time-where teachers instruct us in the application of energy sequences for events. <br><Br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> What are sequences? <br><Br>
    <strong>S:</strong> Timelines exist as energy sequences of events which move. <br><Br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Tell me how you manipulate energy in the timelines. <br><Br>
    <strong>S:</strong> Time is manipulated by compressing and stretching energy particles within a unified field and to regulate its flow ... like playing with rubber bands. <br><Br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Can you change events in the past, present and future? Is that what you mean by manipulation? <br><Br>
    <strong>S:</strong> 	(long pause) No, I can only monitor the energy sequences. We operate as... highwaymen who enter and exit the sequences- which we consider roads-by speeding up and slowing down. Condensing our energy speeds us up and expansion slows us down. It's the same thing with events and people who appear on the sequences as points in the roads. We don't create anything. We intersect as observers. <br><Br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Then who created the time sequences in the first place? <br><Br>
    <strong>S:</strong> (exasperated) How can I know that? At my stage I am only trying to function within the system. <br><Br>

    <strong>S:</strong> We are given one-event assignments ... the human choices around that event all have meaning. The practical applications of what we do involve human streams of thought and actions that join in a river of time. <br>

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> How? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> Energy is the carrier of thought and memory within the sequences and these never pass into oblivion. The conduit by which time is perceived begins with thought-the shaping of an idea-then the event and finally the memory of the event. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> How is all this recorded into the sequences? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> By the vibrational tone of each recorded particle of energy. This is what we recover. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Can the sequences exist in all sorts of alternate realities? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> (pause) Yes ... overlapping and interlaced ... this is what makes the search interesting if one has the skill to find them. All things can be observed and retrieved for study. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> I need more direction here, Obidom. <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> There is a lot I can't tell you. The particles of energy which are part of  the  causation  for  the  setting  up  of  events  in  time  involve vibrational patterns with many alternatives. We view all this human history as useful for future incarnations of people. <br><br>

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Obidom, tell me about your initial training. Certainly, this must be clear in your mind. <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> I was sent to the world of Galath. It is a physical world similar to the geography of Earth. This world once had a great civilization, highly technical, and the Galathians were able to travel to other planets, which led to their undoing. Galath now has no highly intelligent life forms. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> I don't understand why you were sent to a dead world? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> It's not dead as much as vacant. When we arrived for training we assumed a transparent form which resembled the humanoid appearance of the old Galathians. (laughs) <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Tell me about them. <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> I was just thinking ... they were yellowish-green people, very tall and willowy, without apparent joints ... they had large, multi-faceted insect eyes ... <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> What were they like as a people? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> The Galathians were wise but foolish-like the rest of us. They came to believe in their invincibility. <br><br>

In all these lives we had freedom of choice. Our current life represents all past experiences both pleasant and unpleasant, and so we are the product of all our former choices. Add to this the fact that we may have deliberately placed ourselves in situations that test how we will react to events in our current life, which are not perceived by the conscious mind. This too involves personal choices. We occupy a particular body for many reasons. The young motorcycle rider, by his mother's own admission, lived for speed and essentially got a high from the dangers of his obsession.<br>

    Because my last section on time opened the door to future probabilities and possibilities, it is appropriate to examine the ramifications of free will a little further. Reincarnation would mean nothing if all life was predetermined. In my remarks about timelines, I suggested that the future may exist in many realities. People who have premonitions about the future may be right or wrong. If someone saw themselves being killed in a certain place and time and it didn't happen, this potential causality could mean it was only the most dire of alternative possibilities.

    I had a client who was killed at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 as a newly recruited Union soldier. His name was John and he lived in a small community near Gettysburg. Although just sixteen, John and his sweetheart, Rose, had begun to talk of marriage in the future. The night before the three-day battle began, a Union officer rode into John's area looking for a young non-combatant who could ride a horse well to deliver dispatches. John had no plans to enlist in the war because of his age and the fact he was needed on his mother's farm. The Union officer found John and hurriedly explained his urgency, promising that John's enlistment would end when the battle ended. John was a fine horseman and he impulsively agreed to ride for the Union because "I did not want to miss out on a chance for the grand adventure." He had to leave immediately without saying goodbye to anyone. John was killed the next day.

We were supposed to be married!" These soulmates quickly realized that John had abruptly chosen a path that deviated from his probable life. Even so, each path has karmic benefits of some sort, as was the case with John's brief Army experience.<br><br>

    I asked this client if he had been shown scenes in the screening room of what was going to happen at Gettysburg. He replied, "No, I accepted what they showed me up to the age of sixteen because I knew they had good reasons to reveal only what I needed to know before that life. I have faith in the decisions of my guides." John, the boy soldier, was not shown the possibility of his death at Gettysburg and this is very typical with such cases. Yet what about those cases where an untimely death is such a high probability in life that there is a necessity for the planners to give us the opportunity to volunteer for these bodies as a matter of personal benefit from the experience?

    This is a case of euthanasia involving a subject named Sandy. She provided me with another example of an instance where a death scene was shown to the principals of a future life. As is so often true with souls who must witness their death in advance of a life, volunteering is part of the contract. During my intake interview, I learned that Sandy was closely bonded to her brother, Keith, and that they were members of a large family. As his older sister, she had taken care of him like a mother while they were growing up. Keith was hot-headed and in his teenage years he lived on the ragged edge, driving fast cars and getting into numerous scrapes with the law. Sandy told me Keith lived as though he had a death wish. She added that Keith had hurt some people along the way with a capricious life style, but he had a good heart and his zest for living each day to its fullest was contagious.

Keith was the fun-loving prankster in their group and over many previous centuries he had been rather careless of others' feelings. In consultations with his guide and members of the group, Keith recognized it was essential that he learn humility in order to advance. Being a soul of temerity, Keith asked for a life where he would be given a potent challenge toward acquiring humility rather than have this lesson strung out over many lives. He was warned that accelerated lives can be very rough. Keith said he was ready. It was a bitter pill in the Ring to discover he would have to volunteer for an athletic body which would be immobilized by ALS. Sandy said that there was a point in the life selection room where her brother almost backed out. I will pick up her narrative at this place in our session.

    To a devout religionist, this man's life did not belong to himself, but to God. While it is true that we are given our bodies by an act of divine creation, everyone's life belongs ultimately to them. The right to die is a hotly debated topic in legal circles today, especially as it pertains to doctor-assisted suicide with the terminally ill. Knowing what I do about how our souls choose life, with the free will to make changes during that life, I believe we clearly have the right to choose death when no quality of life remains and there is no possibility of recovery.

A soul's immortal character is influenced by all the attributes and temperament of the brain, which challenges the soul's maturity.

    I have said there are souls who are more susceptible than others in falling prey to negative influences in life. Most of the cases in this book, reflect souls who struggle in opposition or work in harmonious conjunction with their bodies. Souls combating the need to control may not blend well with a body ego disposed to confrontation. On the other hand, a cautious, low-energy soul could choose a rather passive, introverted body temperament in order to institute boldness in concert with its host.<br>

    When a soul joins with a new baby, I can be fairly sure the partnership will address both the soul's shortcomings and a body-mind who needs this particular soul. The planners choose bodies for us which are intended to combine our character defects with certain body temperaments to produce specific personality combinations. From clients who are medical doctors and physiologists, I have been given brief anatomical glimpses about souls entering the developing brain of a fetus. Case 66 is an example. Posthypnotic suggestions have enabled subjects in these professions to sketch out simplified diagrams of what they were trying to say about these linkages while under hypnosis. This has helped my understanding.

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> I would like to know if the initial transition into the fetus is always about the same for you? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> No, it is not. Even though I might have had x-ray vision into the mind of the child during life selection, my entry can still be ragged. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Give me your most recent example of a difficult entry. <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> Three lives ago, I joined with a very stiff, unreceptive brain. It felt my presence was invasive. This was unusual because most of my host bodies accept my presence. I'm ordinarily considered to be a new roommate.

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Are you saying this particular host body felt you were an alien presence that it should reject? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> No, it was a dull mind of dense energy pockets. My arrival was an intrusion on its lack of mental activity ... there was ... isolation between compartments of the brain ... creating resistance to ... communication. Lethargic minds require more effort on my part. They resist change. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Change of what? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> Of my being in its space, requiring some reaction to deal with this fact. I caused this mind to think and it was not a curious mind. I began pushing buttons and found it did not want to be summoned by me.<br><br> 
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> What did you expect? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> From my review in the sphere (the Ring), I saw the end result of an adult mind but I didn't see all the difficulties with the baby's mind ... when it was new.<br><br> 
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> I see, and you are saying this mind considered your intrusion as a threat? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> No, only a nuisance. Eventually, I was accepted and the child and I adapted to each other.<br><br>

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Let's go back to your statement about pushing buttons. Please explain to me what this means to you with a standard entry into the fetus of your choice? <br><br>
	<strong>S:</strong> When I enter a developing brain � am accustomed to joining around the fourth month-our guides give us some latitude here-but I never enter after the sixth month. When I enter the womb of the mother I create a red light of tight energy and direct it up and down the spinal column of the baby-following a network of neurons to the brain.

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Then, what do you do? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> Play my red light around the dura mater-the outer layer of the brain ... gently ... <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Why red light? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> This allows me to be ... especially sensitive to the physical feelings of this new person. I meld my energy warmth to the gray-blues of brain matter. Before I get there, the brain is simply gray. What I am doing is turning on the lights in a dark room with a tree in the middle.<br><br>

    <strong>S:</strong> (intensely) The tree is the stem. I park myself between the two hemispheres of the brain to get a ringside seat as to how this system will function. Then I move around the branches of the tree to investigate the circuitry. I want to know how dense the energy is in the fibers around the wheel of the cerebral cortex folding around the thalamus ...

    <strong>S:</strong> A mind that has excessive density in certain areas means there are blockages which inhibit the bridges between efficient neuron activity. I want to make some adjustments in these road blocks with my energy if I can-you know-while the brain is still forming. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> You can make a difference in how the brain develops? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> (laughs at me) Of course! Did you think souls are passengers on a train? I stimulate these areas ever so slightly. <br><br>

    <strong>S:</strong> That is our expectation.

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> What do you see in the future for the brain with continued evolution and the influence of souls as a stimulus?<br><br> 
	<strong>S:</strong> Mental telepathy. <br><br><br>
	Certainly, I have had younger souls who appear to be more inactive after body entry than case 66. This is a far sight better than agitating the child by ineptness from overzealous, inexperienced souls. The average soul probes their new host for information but in a way that has been described as "tickling the child to give it pleasure." Essentially, this is an important time for integration between body and soul with the mother also mentally entering into this process of getting acquainted. By no means is the seat of the soul limited to the brain. Soul energy radiates throughout the whole body of the child. <br><br>
Case 66 is a medical doctor. My next case comes from a non-medically oriented client about the union of two entities to form one whole as a new life begins. Each soul has its own preferences about when and how they wish to enter the fetus. The following case gives us an indication of the procedures used by a very considerate, evolved soul. <br><br><br>

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Isn't there a downside to entering late? I mean, you are then dealing with a more independent individual. <br><br>

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> (being dense to elicit a response) Talk-talk to a fetus-what are you saying ...? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> (laughs at me) Of course we interact with the child. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Take me through this slowly. Who says what first? <br><br>

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> (with deliberate provocation) Isn't that deceitful? You haven't come to play. You have come to occupy this mind. <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> Oh, please! Who have you been talking to? This mind and my soul were created to be together. Do you think I am some sort of foreign intruder on Earth? I have joined with babies who welcomed me as if I were expected. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> There are souls who have had a different experience.<br><br> 
    <strong>S:</strong> Look, I know souls who are clumsy. They go in like bulls in a china shop with their over-eagerness to get started with an agenda. Too much frontal energy all at once sets up resistance. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> In your current lifetime, was the child at all anxious about your entry? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> No, they don't know enough yet to be anxious. I begin by caressing the brain. I am able to immediately project warm thoughts of love and companionship. Most of the babies just accept me as being part of themselves. A few hold back-like my current body.<br><br> 
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Oh, really? What was unusual about this fetus?<br><br>

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> I think that's a very big deal. Essentially, the child is acknowledging that its identity depends on you. <br><br>

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> So you don't feel the child senses it is being forced to give up something of its individuality? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> No, we have come as souls to give the child ... depth of personality. Its being is enhanced by our presence. Without us they would largely function as unripened fruit. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> But does the child understand any of this before birth? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> It only knows that I want to be friends so we can do things together. We begin by communicating with each other with simple things such as an uncomfortable body position in the mother's womb. There have been times when the umbilical chord was wrapped around the neck of the baby and I have calmed the child where otherwise it might have squirmed and made things worse. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Please continue with how you assist the baby. <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> I prepare the child for birth, which is going to be a shock when it happens. Imagine being forced out of a warm, comfortable, secure womb into the bright lights of a hospital room ... the noise ... having to breathe air ... being handled. The child appreciates my help because my primary goal now is to combat fear by soothing the brain with assurances that everything will be fine. <br>

    <strong>S:</strong> We must be proficient. During much of my existence I had little or no effect on my mothers if they were frightened, sad or angry during pregnancy. You must be able to align your energy vibrations with both the child and the mother's natural body rhythms. You have to harmonize three sets of wave levels-which includes your own-to soothe the mother. I might even have the baby kick the mother to let her know we are all right. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Then at birth, I supposed the hard work of the merger is over? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> To be honest, the merger isn't complete yet for me. I talk to my body as a second entity up to the age of six. It is better not to force a full meld right away. We play games as two people for a while. <br><br>
