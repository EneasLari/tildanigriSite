It is well known that the process of grief survival involves going through the initial shock, then coping with denial, anger, depression and finally arriving at some sort of acceptance.  Each one of these stages of emotional turmoil varies in length of time and intensity from months up to years. Losing someone with whom we had a deep bond can bring such despair that it feels as though we are in a bottomless pit where escape is impossible because death seems so final.<br>

  	<td>In Western society, the belief in the finality of death is an obstacle to healing.  We have a dynamic culture where the possibility of our loss of personhood is unthinkable.  The dynamics of death in a loving family is akin to a successful stage play that is thrown into disarray due to the loss of one of its stars.  The supporting cast flounders around over the need for script changes.  Dealing with this huge hole in the story left by the departed affects the future roles of the remaining players. There is a dichotomy here because when souls are in the spirit world preparing for a new life, they laugh about being in rehearsals for their next big stage play on Earth. They know all roles are temporary.</td>

	<strong>Dr. N:</strong> Are you finished? <br><br>

	Most souls I work with perform rather well from the spirit world on a physical body. Typically, they choose to work in concentrated areas using the beam effect described by Tammano. These loving energy projections can be very potent, even from the inexperienced soul, to people who have sustained emotional and physical trauma.

Healing involves the subtle touching of body organs while eliciting certain emotional reactions which can include the use of the senses. Skilfully applied energy beams can evoke recognition by sight, sound, taste and smell. The whole idea with recognition is to convince the person grieving that the individual they love is still alive.

  	One of the primary ways the newly departed soul uses to reach people 
who love them is through the dream state. The grief that has overwhelmed the conscious mind is temporarily pushed out of a frontal position in our thoughts when we are asleep. Even if we are in a fitful state of sleep, the unconscious mind is now more open for reception. 
Unfortunately, the person who is grieving will all too often wake up 
from a dream that could have contained a message and allow it to slip 
away from memory without writing anything down. Either the images 
and symbols they saw while asleep didn't mean anything at the time, 
or the dream sequence was chalked off as wishful thinking if, for 
example, the dreamer saw themselves with the deceased.

    I classify dreams in three ways and one of them is the cleaning house state. At times in the night many stray thoughts from the day are scrambled and swept out of the mind as gobbledygook. We can't make sense of it because there is none. On the other hand, we all know there is a more cognitive side to dreaming. I divide this state into two parts, problem solving and spiritual, with only a fine line between them. There are people who have been given a premonition about some future event as an outgrowth of dreams. Our state of mind may be altered by dreams.

    Jung said, "Dreams embody suppressed wishes and fears but may also give expression to inescapable truths which are not illusions or wild fantasies." Sometimes these truths are couched in metaphoric puzzles and represented as archetypal images during our dreams. Dream symbols are culturally generalized and dream glossaries are not immune to this prejudice.

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> What methods have you tried so far? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> I project my thoughts with an orange-yellow light, like the flame of a candle, and place my light around her head, sending loving thoughts. I'm not effective. She doesn't realize I am with her.  I am going for a dream.<br><br>

	<strong>Dr. N:</strong> How can you be sure she won't think this is all a projection of her desire for you and discount the dream as not being real? <br><br>
	<strong>S:</strong> The influence of a vivid dream like this is very great. When my mother wakes up, her mind has a vivid impression of this landscape with me and suspects I am with her.  In time the memory is so real she is sure of it. <br><br>
	<strong>Dr. N:</strong> Sylvia, does the image of the dream move from the unconscious to a conscious reality because of your energy transfer? <br><br>
	<strong>S:</strong> Yes, it is a filtering process where I continue to send waves of energy into her over the next few days until she begins to accept my passing. I want her to believe I am still part of her and always will be. <br><br>
	Turning back to Phil's sleep state, it was evident Sylvia did not intend to stay long to manifest her feelings within his unconscious mind. Dreams do not appear to occur in the deep delta stages of brain-wave activity where there is no rapid eye movement. REM sleep, also known as paradoxical sleep, is a much lighter and therefore more active dream state occurring mostly in the early and late stages of sleep.

dreamer is not aware of script tampering with the sequences.  This is what Sylvia was doing with her mother.  She was waiting for the right sort of ongoing dream to enter and initiate a smooth fit.  As difficult as this approach seems, it is evident to me the second procedure is more complex.

Creating or altering scenes in the mind of a dreamer is intended to convey a message. I see as this an act of service and love. If the dream implantation is not performed skillfully to make the dream meaningful, the sleeper moves on and wakes up in the morning remembering only disjointed fragments or nothing at all about the dream.

    Dream symbolism moves on many levels in the mind, some of which are abstract while others are emotional.

    It took me quite a long while before I found an advanced subject apprenticed to a Dreammaster, a title I feel is appropriate for Axinar in case 6. As with any spiritual technique, some souls show more inclination than others toward acquiring advanced skills. In case 6, Bud not only originated a sequence of dreams in Walt's mind but then engaged in the more complex technique of linking them into a central theme of love and support for his brother. Finally, Bud provided physical evidence that he was there through the use of a hidden baseball. I take nothing away from Sylvia in case 5, because she was very effective entering her mother's dream to give her peace without disruption to the dreamer. It's just that case 6 demonstrated more spiritual artistry. <br><br>

    When souls have difficulty reaching the mind of a troubled adult they might resort to using children as conduits for their messages.

    Souls don't give up easily on us. Another way spirits touch people is 
through environmental settings associated with their memory. These contacts are effective to minds which may be closed to all other forms of spiritual communication. The following case illustrates this method. My subject, a woman called Nancy in her last life, died of a sudden stroke after thirty-eight years of marriage to Charles. Her husband was stuck between the denial and anger stages of grief and his emotions were so pent up that he could not accept help from their friends or seek outside professional counseling.

    Nancy's soul had tried reaching her husband in several ways for months after the funeral. His stoic nature created such a wall around himself that Charles had not really cried since his wife's death. To overcome this obstacle, Nancy decided she could reach his inner mind through his sense of smell by connecting with an environmental setting familiar to both of them. The use of sense organs by souls complements communication with the subconscious mind. Nancy decided to use her garden, specifically a rose bush, to reach Charles.

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> So, in a sense, Charles was blocking the conflicting images between his conscious thoughts and what you were projecting in his unconscious mind? <br><br>

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Wouldn't red roses suit your purpose just as well? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong>  (flatly) No. It was then I switched my energy to Sabine, the woman I knew who ran the store. She was at my funeral and was 	aware I loved white roses. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> I don't think I know where this is going, Nancy. There were no white roses. Charles bought the red roses and then left for home. Wasn't this enough for you? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> (laughing at me) You men! The white rose is me. The next morning Sabine personally drove to my house and delivered a big pot of white roses. She told my husband that she got them from another nursery and this is what I would have wanted. Then she left Charles standing bewildered in our driveway. He carried them over to the hole he had dug where my old rose bush had been and stopped. The roses were in his face. He smelled their fragrance-but what was more important, the wash of white was combined with the scent, (my subject pauses tearfully as she recreates this moment) <br><br>

Spirits may prefer to communicate with us in the form of ideas. Here is a quote from a letter I received from a former client about his departed wife, Gwen. I believe our session together assisted in his discovery of the best way to receive his wife's thoughts: <br><br>

I finally recognized the imprint of Gwen's thoughts after getting nothing during my meditations. She was a literary person who used word thoughts rather than pictures to generate feeling in me. I had to learn to integrate word flashes from her into my own manner of speaking- which she knows-in order to decipher what she was telling me. I see more clearly now how I can touch Gwen with my mind."

    Derek was a man in his sixties who came to see me from Canada to evaluate his life and try and resolve his greatest sadness. When he was a young man, he lost his beautiful four-year-old daughter, Julia. Her death was sudden, unexpected and so devastating that he and his wife decided to have no more children. <br><br>

    I placed Derek in deep hypnosis and took him to a scene following his last life where he appeared in front of his council. We then discovered that one of his major current life lessons was learning to cope with tragedy. Derek had been deficient in this area during his past two lives by falling apart and making life more difficult for family survivors who depended upon him. He is doing much better in his current life. What was especially interesting for me about this case was a single incident that happened to Derek some twenty years after Julia's death.<br>

    Derek had recently lost his wife to cancer and was in mourning. One day, feeling very despondent, he walked to a nearby amusement park. After a while he sat down on a bench near a carousel. Listening to the music, Derek watched the children happily going around in circles on colorful wooden animals. He saw from a distance one little girl who looked like Julia and tears flooded his eyes. Just then a young woman of about twenty appeared and asked if she could sit down next to him. It was a warm day. She was dressed in white muslin, holding a cold drink in her hand.

    Derek nodded but said nothing while the woman enjoyed her drink and talked about growing up in England and coming to Canada because she was particularly attracted to Vancouver. She introduced herself as Heather and Derek noticed a glow of sunlight around her that gave the young woman a shining, angelic quality.<br><br>
    Time seemed to be suspended for Derek as the conversation turned to family and what Heather was going to do with her new life in Canada. Derek found himself talking to her as a father and the more they conversed, the more he felt he knew her. Finally, Heather stood up and placed her hand tenderly on Derek's shoulder. She smiled at him and said, "I know you are worried about me-please don't be. I'm all right and it's going to be a wonderful life. We will see each other again some day, I know."<br><br>

    Derek told me that as Heather walked away and gave him a final wave he saw his daughter and felt at peace. During our session, Derek recognized that the reincarnated soul of Julia had come to him and provided the assurance he had not really lost her. When we suffer the absence of people we love they may come to us in mysterious ways, often when our minds are detached in a shallow alpha state. Take these moments as messages from the other side and allow them to bring sustenance to you.

    In recent years there has been a resurgence in the popularity of angels. Many clients initially think they see angels when I regress them into the spirit world, especially those with strong religious convictions. This reaction is similar to the devotional responses of some people who have had near-death experiences.

  However, regardless of prior religious conditioning, my subjects soon realize the etheric beings they are visualizing in hypnosis represent their guides and soul companions who have come to meet them. <br>
  Our spiritual teachers have different styles and techniques, just as teachers on Earth. Their immortal character has been matched to our own essence in a variety of ways. The next two abbreviated cases illustrate my contention that personal guides and soulmates, however they are represented, contact us from the other side if we require consolation.

    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> Were her face and demeanor different to you while you were under hypnosis, compared to what you saw when awake? <br><br>
    <strong>S:</strong> (laughs) Today there were no wings or a halo, but bright light-	that was the same-and her face and gentle manner were the same too. I also see that in our spirit group she can be ... sharply	instructive. <br><br>
    <strong>Dr. N:</strong> More of a teacher and less of a grief counselor, you mean?<br><br>

    <strong>S:</strong> No, in the beginning I saw her floating over my head in my bedroom. I had my arms wrapped around a pillow pretending it was Harry, but I had stopped crying. She became fuzzy after I first saw her and I realized then I had to listen carefully for her voice. In the days that followed I heard Niath more than I saw her ... but I had to listen.

    When a soul once again returns to a pure energy state in the spirit world, it no longer feels hate, anger, envy, jealousy and the like. Nevertheless, I have found two sorts of negative emotions that exist within souls, both of which involve a form of sadness. One of them I would call karmic guilt for making very poor choices, especially when others were hurt by these actions.

    The other form of sadness for souls is not melancholy, dejection, or a mournful unhappiness in the way life has gone on without them since their departure. Rather, sadness in souls comes from a longing to reunite with the Source of their existence. I believe all souls, regardless of their level of development, have this longing to seek perfection for the same reason. The motivating factor for those souls who come to Earth is growth. Thus, the trace of sadness I discern in souls is the absence of elements in their immortal character that they must find to make their energy complete. And so it is a soul's destiny to search for truth in their experiences in order to gain wisdom.<br><br>

    Since souls lose so many negative emotions upon reentering the spirit world, it follows that their positive affections also undergo alterations. For instance, souls feel great love but this love places no conditions upon others for reciprocity because it is given freely. Souls display a universal coherence with each other that is so absolute it is incomprehensible on Earth. This is one reason why souls appear to be both abstract and empathetic to us at the same time.<br><br>
