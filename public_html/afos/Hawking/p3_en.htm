              1) There really is a complete unified  theory, (or a collection of overlapping formulations) which we will someday  discover if we are smart enough. </p>
              <p>2) There is no ultimate theory of the  universe, just an infinite sequence of theories that describe the universe more  and more accurately. </p>
              <p>3) There is no theory of the universe:  events cannot be predicted beyond a certain extent but occur in a random and  arbitrary manner. </p>
              <p>Some would  argue for the third possibility on the grounds that if there were a complete  set of laws, that would infringe God's freedom to change his mind and intervene  in the world. It's a bit like the old paradox: can God make a stone so heavy  that he can't lift it? But the idea that God might want to change his mind is  an example of the fallacy, pointed out by St. Augustine, of imagining God as a  being existing in time: time is a property only of the universe that God  created. Presumably, he knew what he intended when he set it up! With the  advent of quantum mechanics, we have come to recognize that events cannot be  predicted with complete accuracy but that there is always a degree of  uncertainty. If one likes, one could ascribe this randomness to the  intervention of God, but it would be a very strange kind of intervention: there  is no evidence that it is directed toward any purpose. Indeed, if it were, it  would by definition not be random. In modern times, we have effectively removed  the third possibility above by redefining the goal of science: our aim is to  formulate a set of laws that enables us to predict events only up to the limit  set by the uncertainty principle.</p>

              What would it  mean if we actually did discover the ultimate theory of the universe? As was  explained in Chapter 1, we could never be quite sure that we had indeed found  the correct theory, since theories can't be proved. But if the theory was  mathematically consistent and always gave predictions that agreed with  observations, we could be reasonably confident that it was the right one. It  would bring to an end a long and glorious chapter in the history of humanity's  intellectual struggle to understand the universe. But it would also  revolutionize the ordinary person's understanding of the laws that govern the  universe. In Newton's time it was possible for an educated person to have a  grasp of the whole of human knowledge, at least in outline. But since then, the  pace of the development of science has made this impossible. Because theories  are always being changed to account for new observations, they are never  properly digested or simplified so that ordinary people can understand them.</p>
              <table width="356" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
                <tr>
                  <td><img src="images/3_2_en.jpg" width="356" height="476"></td>
                </tr>

              <p>                (...)  <br>
              If a complete  unified theory was discovered, it would only be a matter of time before it was  digested and simplified in the same way and taught in schools, at least in  outline.</p>
              We would then all be able to have some  understanding of the laws that govern the universe and are responsible for our  existence. Even if we do discover a complete unified theory,  it would not mean that we would be able to predict events in general, for two  reasons. The first is the limitation that the uncertainty principle of quantum  mechanics sets on our powers of prediction. There is nothing we can do to get  around that. In practice, however, this first limitation is less restrictive  than the second one. It arises from the fact that we could not solve the equations  of the theory exactly, except in very simple situations. (We cannot even solve  exactly for the motion of three bodies in Newton's theory of gravity, and the  difficulty increases with the number of bodies and the complexity of the  theory.) We already know the laws that govern the behavior of matter under all  but the most extreme conditions. In particular, we know the basic laws that  underlie all of chemistry and biology. Yet we have certainly not reduced these  subjects to the status of solved problems: we have, as yet, had little success  in predicting human behavior from mathematical equations! So even if we do find  a complete set of basic laws, there will still be in the years ahead the  intellectually challenging task of developing better approximation methods, so  that we can make useful predictions of the probable outcomes in complicated and  realistic situations. A complete, consistent, unified theory is only the first  step: our goal is a complete <em>understanding</em> of the events around us, and of our own existence. <br>
