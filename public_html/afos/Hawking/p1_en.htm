            <p>Maxwell's  equations predicted that the speed of light should be the same whatever the  speed of the source, and this has been confirmed by accurate measurements. It follows from this that if a pulse  of light is emitted at a particular time at a particular point in space, then  as time goes on it will spread out as a sphere of light whose size and position  are independent of the speed of the source. After one  millionth of a second the light will have spread out to form a sphere with a  radius of 300 meters; after two millionths of a second, the radius will be 600  meters; and so on. It  will be like the ripples that spread out on the surface of a pond when a stone  is thrown in. The ripples spread out as a circle that gets bigger as time goes  on. If one stacks snapshots of the ripples at different  times one above the other, the expanding circle of ripples will mark out a cone  whose tip is at the place and time at which the stone hit the water (Figure  2:10)</p>

            <p>Similarly, the light  spreading out from an event <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">forms a (three- dimensional) cone in (the four-dimensional) space-time</a>. This cone is called the future light cone of the event. In the  same way we can draw another cone, called the past light cone, which is the set  of events from which a pulse of light is able to reach the given event (Figure  2:11) </p>

            <p>Given an  event <em>P</em>, one can divide the other  events in the universe into three classes. Those events  that can be reached from the event <em>P</em> by a particle or wave traveling at or below the speed of light are said to be  in the future of <em>P</em>.  They will lie within or on the expanding sphere of light emitted from the event <em>P</em>. Thus they  will lie within or on the future light cone of <em>P</em> in the space-time diagram. Only events in the future of <em>P</em> can be affected by what happens at <em>P</em> because nothing can travel faster than light. <br>
              <br>
Similarly,  the past of <em>P</em> can be defined as the  set of all events from which it is possible to reach the event P traveling at  or below the speed of light. It is thus the set of events that can  affect what happens at <em>P</em>.  The events that do not lie in the future or past of <em>P</em> are said to lie in the elsewhere of <em>P</em>. What  happens at such events can neither affect nor be affected by what happens at <em>P</em>. For example, if the sun were to cease  to shine at this very moment, it would not affect things on earth at the  present time because they would be in the elsewhere of the event when the sun  went out (Figure 2:12)</p>

            <p>We would know  about it only after eight minutes, the time it takes light to reach us from the  sun. Only then would events on earth lie in the future light cone of the event  at which the sun went out. Similarly, we do not know what is happening at the  moment farther away in the universe: the light that we see from distant  galaxies left them millions of years ago, and in the case of the most distant  object that we have seen, the light left some eight thousand million years ago.  Thus, when we look at the universe, we are seeing it as it was in the past. </p>
