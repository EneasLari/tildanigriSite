              But Galileo's great scientific  contribution is not limited to the worlds revealed through the telescope which  was ever-developing by he himself. He was a messenger of the stars, who never  ceased to occupy himself with our earthly world as well. So, he showed  particular interest in the phenomena of mechanics. He studied not only the  parabolic course of projectiles, but also the motion of a body on a slope. Also  observing a lamp in the cathedral of Pisa, he proclaimed  the principle that the oscillations of a pendulum are isochronous, which proved  extremely useful for measuring time. &nbsp; </p>

            <p>After all, reversing the  Aristotelian beliefs and contrary to common sense, Galileo proved that all  bodies, whether consisting of iron or down, fall - if, of course, the air  resistance is ignored &ndash; at the same speed. Galileo combined the perspicacity of  observation with experimental investigation and also the deep knowledge of  mathematics. Hence, he laid the foundation, perhaps without realising it  himself, for modern experimental physics. &nbsp; </p>

              <p>Given the breadth of his work  and the fact that the telescope was an important application of the properties of  light, initially it seems paradoxical that light itself preoccupied Galileo&rsquo;s mind  very little. Being more a practical than a theoretical mind, he was more  interested in the proper functioning of the telescope and less on how it works.  Through his great intuition, however, he was led to the perception that light,  just like heat, can be more easily understood as particulate and mechanical  entities. &nbsp; </p>

              <p>Thus, he comes to the  conclusion that when a substance is raised to &quot;the real indivisible atoms&quot;,  then &quot;light is produced&quot;. Therefore light can not be excluded from being some corpus  like the others; it is just smaller, or perhaps the smallest of all. But its  true nature escapes us. Shortly before his death, Galileo even declares that as  regards the substance of light, he is still in the dark. Three centuries later  and after having decisively contributed to the understanding of light, Albert  Einstein will declare the same thing. <br>
                <br>
Although Galileo referred to  light and its properties very little, the turn which he wants light to be  studied as an existing corpus with some real properties and not as a divine or  spiritual subsistence, is clearly shown in his work. Also Galileo&rsquo;s personage  is imprinted with the continuing struggle of the scientific spirit against the  religious dogma and oppression, especially of the Roman Catholic Church. (...)</p>
