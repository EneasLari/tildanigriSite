              <p>One of the easiest ways of  acquiring tranquillity is by breathing in a regular pattern. Most people, unfortunately,  breathe in a manner  which could be termed "suck-blow, suck-blow," they pant along really starving the  brain of oxygen. People seem to think that air is rationed; they have to  gulp it in and puff it out. They seem to think the air they take in is hot, or something,  for no sooner is it  in than they are anxious to get rid of it and get the next load.</p>

              <p> We should learn to breathe slowly and deeply.  We should make sure  that all the stale air is removed from our lungs. If we breathe with only the top  of our lungs, that air which is at the bottom becomes staler and staler. The  better our air supply is, the better our brain power will be, for we cannot live without  oxygen and the  brain is the first thing to be starved of oxygen. </p>

            <p>If our brain is deprived of the  minimum amount of oxygen we feel tired, sleepy, we become slow in our motion,  and we find it difficult to think. Sometimes, too, we find that we get a bad headache,  then we go out  into the fresh air which cures the headache, and also proves that one does need  plenty of oxygen.</p>

              <p>A regular breathing pattern  soothes ruffled emotions. If you are feeling thoroughly bad tempered - "out of sorts" - and  really  would  like to do violence to someone, take a deep breath instead, the deepest breath  you can manage, and hold it for a few seconds. Then let it out slowly over a  few seconds. Do that a few times, and you will find that you calm down more quickly than you  thought  possible.</p>

              <p>Do not just suck in breath as fast as you can,  and then blow it out  as fast as you can. Draw in the breath slowly, steadily, and think - as is truly  the case - that you are inhaling life and vitality itself. Let us give an  illustration; compress your chest, and try to expel as much air as you  possibly can, force your lungs in so that - if you wish - your tongue is  hanging out from the lack of air. Then, over some ten seconds of time,  completely fill your lungs, throw out your chest, take in as much air as you can,  and then  cram  in a little more. When you have got in as much air as you possibly can, hold  it for five seconds, and after that five seconds slowly let out the air, so  slowly that you take seven seconds to get rid of the air within you. </p>

            <p>Exhale completely, force your  muscles inwards to squeeze out as much air as you can. Then start all over again. It might be  a good idea if you do this half a dozen times and you will find that your  frustrations and your bad, bad mood has gone, you will feel better inside too; you will  find that you are beginning to get inner composure.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
