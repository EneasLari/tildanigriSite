            <p>When I was quite young I  had a special operation which was called the opening of the third eye.&nbsp; In it a sliver of hard wood, which had been soaked in special herbal solutions, was inserted in  the centre of my forehead in order to stimulate a gland which gave me increased  powers of clairvoyance. I was born markedly clairvoyant, but then, after the operation,  I was really abnormally so, and I could see people with their aura around them  as if they were wreathed in flames of fluctuating colours. <a href="javascript:;" class="la"  onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">From their auras</a>  I could divine their thoughts; what ailed them, what their hopes and fears were.</p>

              <p>Now that I have left Tibet I am trying to  interest western doctors in a device which would enable any doctor and surgeon  to see the human aura as it really is, in colour. I know that if doctors and surgeons can  see the aura, they can  see what really affects a person. So that by looking at the colours, and  by the outline of the moving bands, the specialist can tell exactly what illnesses  a person  is  suffering from. Moreover, this can be told before there is any visible sign in  the physical body itself, because the aura shows evidence of cancer, TB,  and other complaints, many months before it attacks the physical body. Thus, by  having  such  early warning of the onset of disease the doctor can treat the complaint, and cure  it infallibly. </p>

              <p>To my horror, and  very deep sorrow, western doctors are not at all interested. They appear to  think it is something to do with magic, instead of being just ordinary  common sense, as it is. Any engineer will know that high tension wires have a  corona  around  them. So has the human body, and it is just an ordinary physical thing which  I want to show to the specialists, and they reject it. That is a tragedy.  But it will come  in time. The tragedy is that so many people must suffer and die needlessly,  until it does come.</p>
