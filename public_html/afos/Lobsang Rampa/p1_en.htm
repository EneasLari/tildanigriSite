            <p>Medicine and surgery were my particular strong points.&nbsp; I studied these with avidity, and I was given  every facility to study dead bodies.&nbsp; It  is a belief in the west that the lamas of Tibet never do anything  to bodies if it means making an opening.&nbsp;  The belief is, apparently, that Tibetan medical science is rudimentary,  because the medical lamas treat only the exterior and not the interior.&nbsp; That is not correct. The ordinary lama, I  agree, never opens a body, it is against his own form of belief.&nbsp; But there was a special nucleus of lamas, of whom I  was one, who were trained to do operations, and to do operations which  were possibly even beyond the scope of western science.</p>

two branches at once, and that meant studying twice as hard as the  average.&nbsp; I did not look upon that with  any great favour!</p>

We did  not keep notebooks, we committed everything to memory. I learned metaphysical  subjects as well.

They are the relics of an age-old civilization which is almost beyond  memory, beyond racial memory almost, and on the walls were the records,  pictorial records of things that flow in the air, and things that went beneath the  earth.  In  another stage on initiation I saw the carefully preserved bodies of giants,  ten feet, and fifteen feet long. </p>
