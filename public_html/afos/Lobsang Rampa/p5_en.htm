            <p>The Akashic Record, then, is a  form of vibration, not necessarily light vibrations because it also embraces  sound. It is a form of vibration which upon Earth has no term which can  describe it. The  nearest one can do is to liken it to a radio wave. We have about us at all  times radio waves coming in from all parts of the world; every one of them  brings in a different program, different languages, different music and  different times. <br>

            <p>It is possible that waves are coming in  from one part of the world which contains a program which, to us, is being  broadcast tomorrow! All these waves are coming to us constantly, but we are  oblivious to them, and  not until we have some mechanical device which we call a radio set can we  receive those waves and slow them down so that they become audible and  comprehensible to us. Here, with a mechanical or electrical device, we slow  down radio frequency waves and convert them to audio frequency waves. In much  the same way, if, on Earth, we could slow down the wave&nbsp; of the Akashic Record we should  undoubtedly be able to put authentic historical scenes on the television  screen, and then the historians would throw a fit when they saw that the history as  printed in books is completely, completely wrong! </p>

              <p>The Akashic Record is the  indestructible vibrations consisting of the sum total of human knowledge which  emanates from the world in much the same way as the radio program is broadcast, it goes on and on.  Everything that has happened on this Earth still exists in vibration form. When  we get out of the body we do not use a special device to understand these  waves; we use nothing to slow them down, instead, in getting out of the body,  our own  "wave  receptors" are speeded up so that, with practice, with training, we can receive that  which we term the Akashic Record. </p>
