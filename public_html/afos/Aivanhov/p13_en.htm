              <p>Everything  that exists - be it human beings, animals, plants or even the stones in the  ground - is surrounded by its own subtle, fluidic atmosphere made up of the  particles and emanations it is constantly giving off. It is this atmosphere  that constitutes <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">the aura</a>. Of  course, it is not visible except to clairvoyants, in fact a great many people  don't even know that it exists. The aura is a kind of halo which surrounds  every human being, the only difference being that some people's aura is immense  and very brilliant, extending its gloriously varied colours and intense  vibrations to great distances, whereas others are meagre and lustreless, with  dirty, blurred colours.</p>

            <p>The aura can be compared to the skin of our physical  bodies and you all know how vital the skin is. It serves several important  purposes, first amongst them being that of protection: like a shield or a suit  of armour, it protects us against blows, sudden changes of temperature and so  on. Another function of the skin is to serve as an organ of exchange: it  breathes in and out, absorbing certain elements and eliminating others. And  finally, the skin serves as a sense organ which enables us to experience  sensations of heat and cold, contact with other bodies, pain, and so on. But my  intention is not to talk about the functions of the skin: that is not my concern. </p>

              <p>What I  am interested in today is in drawing a parallel between the skin and the aura.  The aura has exactly the same functions as the skin. You could say that it is  the skin of the soul which it surrounds and protects; it is also its sense  organ and, finally, it is the means of communication which enables the soul to  receive the cosmic currents flowing through space and to communicate and  exchange with others: with other human souls, other creatures of the universe,  even with the stars in the heavens and with the supreme universal soul.<br>

            <div align="justify">
              <p>Thanks to our aura, therefore, we benefit from a  continuing relationship of reciprocal exchange with the forces of nature. The  cosmic, planetary and zodiacal influences ceaselessly flowing through space  reach out to touch us, and depending on the purity and sensitivity of our aura  and the colours it contains, we may capture or fail to capture certain specific  forces. Our aura, therefore, is like an antenna, it is an instrument which  detects and receives messages, waves and forces coming to us from the length  and breadth of the universe.</p>
