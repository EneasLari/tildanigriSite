              <p>You  must understand that the only solution to the problems of love is <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">love</a> itself. Many  have come to me to complain about certain illnesses or imbalances and I say to  them, &quot;Why did you stop loving? These troubles came because you restrained your  love. Love is a mighty torrent, but as you did not know this and how to deal  with it, you repressed it, and the repression led to devastation as the torrent  swept away all barriers.</p>

              <p>The more you shut yourself off, the more you are  miserly with love, the greater the complications you will experience. My God,  if you would only be generous, you would be saved; give your love to  everything. I have discovered this secret and this is what I do. Quite clearly  people think that I am a little childish and say, &quot;Poor chap, him and his  heart...&quot; But that's precisely it! With my heart I have found the secret which  you, with all your highly developed intelligence, haven't yet discovered.&quot;<br>
Thank Heaven each day for the wonders around you, for the millions  of beautiful women and strong, intelligent men you have not yet had the  happiness of meeting. </p>

My suggestion  astonishes you as you are not used to rejoicing over ideas like this. Indeed,  it is a very unusual way of thinking, but it is so effective! Try it and see!</p>

              <p>You say, &quot;Yes, but this goes against all the laws of  morality. If everyone loved everyone, the family would no longer exist.&quot; Of  course it would, it would be just one big family and that's no bad thing. When  I say that men must love all women and women must love all men that does not  mean that they should have lots of experiences and be unfaithful to each other.<br>

              <p>No, they must be faithful, but they must also realize  that no one man or woman can give everything and that you yourself cannont give  everything to your beloved. So we should live and work together, but love the  whole word, smile at the whole world, and leave our partners free to do the same.  Go on loving each other, go on being together, but enlarge your concept of love  and learn to be happy with subtle joys. </p>
