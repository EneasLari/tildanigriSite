              <p>At  first glance, it is quite difficult to separate sexuality from love. Everything  comes from God and, <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">all the energy which flows through man has divine origins</a>. However,  this energy has different effects according to what it is passing through.  Think of electricity. Electricity is an energy which we cannot define, but when  it passes through a light bulb it becomes light, although it is not light  itself.</p>

In just the same way, there is a cosmic  force which alters its character according to the human organ it passes  through. When it goes through the brain, it becomes intelligence and reasoning  powers; through the solar plexus (or the Hara centre), it becomes sensations  and feelings; through the muscular system, it becomes movement, and when it  passes through the genital organs, it becomes attraction for the opposite sex.  It is the same energy wherever it goes.</div></td>

              <p>Sexual energy comes from very  high up, but on passing through the genital organs it arouses sensations,  excitement and the desire to get closer to each other. It is quite possible  that with all these manifestations there may be absolutely no love. This is  what happens with animals. At set periods during the  year, they mate. Is it done with love? No, for they often tear each other  apart, and with some insects like the praying mantis and certain spiders, the  females eat the male. This is not love, but pure sexuality. Love begins when  this energy touches other centres in man, such as his heart, his mind, his soul  and his spirit at the same time as it touches his genitals. At this moment the  attraction and the desire to draw closer to someone becomes aesthetic and is  made full of light by luminous thoughts and feelings.<br>

            When you no longer stop  at a few coarse, physical sensations, but feel the higher degrees of this  cosmic force penetrating you, then you are feeling love and you can communicate  with heavenly regions.</div>
