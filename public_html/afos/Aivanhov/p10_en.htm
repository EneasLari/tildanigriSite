              <p>Ever since Jesus said, &quot;My Heavenly Father is always  at work, and I am working with Him&quot;, two thousand years ago, no one has ever  fathomed the significance of his words. No one has ever wondered what God's  work was, how He worked or why Jesus associated himself with His work. The  truth is that God's work is immense, gigantic! Even I lay no claim to have  understood it. It makes one's mind spin only to think of it.</p>

            <p>The work of Christ is a work of the spirit, a work of  thought by which everything is purified, harmonized and illuminated; by which  everything is brought to converge on the one Divine Source, so that the waters  of that Source may vivify the earth and all its creatures. This is why Jesus  also asked his Father to give his disciples life in abundance, for life is the  divine water which makes everything grow and flourish. Without that water, that  life, man is a desert. Christ's work is to cause life to flow, and it is this  work that man, the son of God, must also learn to do. </p>
