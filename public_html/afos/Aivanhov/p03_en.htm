            <p>I have  seen so many people in my life, who have tried to free themselves, but they all  go about it so clumsily, in ways that are dangerous for themselves and for  others! I have always told them, &quot;Now look, suppose your house is old and  tumbling down; it is very uncomfortable and you don't want to live in it any  more. I quite understand; that's normal. But don't pull it down until you have  built another one in its place, otherwise you'll be out on the street, at the  mercy of the wind and rain - symbolically speaking&quot;.</p>

            <p>This is exactly what I mean when I tell you that  before you can free yourselves from your present attachments, you have to  attach yourselves to something new. This new attachment is the new, better  house you have to build and, once you have built it, you will be free to pull  down the old one. But you must not do it the other way round and detach  yourself before you are safely attached to something else, otherwise your  detachment will be useless; you will simply find yourself attached to all kinds  of erratic elements and your situation will be even more painful than before.  So remember: do not detach yourselves before attaching yourselves; do not  destroy before you have built anew.</p>

              <p>Now, one more example, just to show you that when I  tell you something you can always find confirmation of the truth of it in all  the manifestations of nature. Suppose you have cut yourself and, under the scab  which has formed over the wound, a new skin is beginning to grow. If you  scratch at the scab and pull it off before the new skin is fully formed, you  will simply reopen the wound and then you will have to wait for the whole  process to take place all over again. Before you pull off the scab you must  &quot;build your new house&quot;, that is you must allow the new skin to form over the  wound. <br>

              <p>If you were really observant you would see that the  human organism, nature, trees, in fact everything in the universe except man,  respects this order of things.<br>
Human beings want to be free, but as they do not  realize the danger of breaking away from old attachments before they have  created new ones, they are always getting caught out by unexpected  difficulties. The thing is that if you do not take care to ensconce higher  realities in the places you have cleared out in your heart and mind, all kinds  of other entities will slip in, and you will be in an terrible fix. Your hearts  and minds must be fully occupied by a very lofty ideal, by all that is best,  most noble and most luminous. That is why Initiates teach their disciples  always to give first place to the Lord. Even if this seems utterly ridiculous  and in complete contradiction to all the modern ideas, do it; put the Lord  firmly in first place.</p>

              <p>Most educators do not know this law which says that  one should create new bonds before detaching oneself from the old ones. You  have to show people alternatives, let them taste other realities, and that is  what I do. </p>
          I know very well that I  could never detach you from certain habits or mental attitudes if I did not  begin by attaching you to something else. That is why I put before you all the  glories of Heaven and the beauty of the soul, the spirit and the sun; I want  you to see for yourselves how beautiful it is and feel the need to attach  yourselves to all that beauty. Later when you look back at all the rest and  realize where you have come from, you will see the horror of it and want to  flee! One must always let people find out for themselves what is best.</div></td>
