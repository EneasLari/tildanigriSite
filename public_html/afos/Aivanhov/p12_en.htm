              <p>It is  instinct that urges us to avenge ourselves, not wisdom. If someone hits you,  you hit back without thinking. I believe I have already told you about the  three yogis who, hoping to attain perfection, withdrew into the forest to pray  and meditate. A man came by and hit one of the yogis in the face and  immediately he jumped up and hit him back twice. For him, perfection was still  something to be hoped for. The second yogi was also struck and was about to  jump up and hit back when an instant of reflection made him sit down again. He  at least had learned a measure of self-control. As for the third yogi, he did  not even notice when he was hit; he just went on meditating. As you see, there  are different categories of human beings.</p>

            <p>The first yogi belonged to the category of those who  still react according to justice - and sometimes to injustice. The second yogi  belonged to the category of those who control themselves, because they take the  time to reflect. He thought to himself, &quot;There is no point in retaliating; it  will only complicate matters.&quot; The third yogi was so highly evolved that his  enemy's blows made no impression on him.</p>

              <p>And  now I must go even further and say that your enemies are a blessing. You will  be thinking, &quot;The man is out of his mind. How <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">can an enemy be a blessing</a>?&quot; But  this reaction shows that you have not understood much about anything. Truly,  our enemies can be a blessing, for it is they who help us to become strong and  powerful and luminous. It is because you are not enlightened and cannot see  this that you succumb to your enemies. If you were intelligent you would  understand that they are giving you the opportunity to become a divinity. Your  enemies are hidden friends; it is they who oblige you to develop you will-power  and to evolve.</p>

              <p>It is  important to understand that the two principles of light and darkness are  always present in the world, and always at war. This means that if you are on  the side of darkness you will be attacked by light; and if you are on the side  of light you will be attacked by darkness. You have to expect this. Yes, but  that is no reason to throw up your hands and do nothing positive. In spite of  all the hostility and dissension that surrounds you, you must keep working. And  you must keep fighting, but only on condition that you fight with the weapons  of light. The methods I give you are so beneficial that, if you understand  them, you will always be victorious, always on top of circumstances; for they  enable you to use higher energies and forces that are still largely unknown.<br>

              <p>Enemies  are a temptation sent by the invisible world to test you, for your first  reaction is to use the arms they use, to prove that you are stronger than they  are. They are a temptation, therefore. Yes, but they are also a blessing, for  they force you to become stronger. Instead of loafing about in idleness,  instead of resting on your laurels, they force you to surpass yourself. True,  this level of consciousness requires great love and goodness ...</p>
