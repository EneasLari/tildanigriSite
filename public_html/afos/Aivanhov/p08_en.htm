            <p>There is one thing that you have to understand once  and for all in respect to spiritual work, and that is that it involves matter  of such extreme subtlety that it cannot be investigated by ordinary methods.  The work we do on the spiritual level is just as real as that which we do on  the physical plane.</p>

            <p>When you work on the spiritual plane to edify  something, set in motion forces and waves or bring light to the minds of human  beings, your work is no less real than when you chop firewood or make soup on  the physical plane. The only reason you cannot see what you do is that it is a  different kind of matter. Actually though, when someone really lives on the  spiritual plane, he does not need to touch or see its realities in the same way  as he sees those of the physical world. It is enough for him to sense that they  are there. With time, however, they can also materialize on the physical plane.</p>

              <p>If you don't know these laws and you keep expecting  immediate results from your spiritual work, you may easily become discouraged,  and then you may destroy what you had already accomplished, for this very  subtle matter is extremely pliant and easy to mould and, depending on whether  he is convinced and persevering or not, man's work can be constructive or  destructive. Often, in fact, he does a lot of constructive work but never  brings anything to completion because he destroys it again almost at once. But  inevitably, sooner or later, there will be a physical materialization.<br>

              <p>Actually, if you question the Initiates, they will  tell you that everything you see on earth is simply the materialization of  etheric elements which have reached this degree of physical density. If you  have sufficient faith and patience, therefore, all the things you wish for will  also be condensed on the physical plane. </p>
