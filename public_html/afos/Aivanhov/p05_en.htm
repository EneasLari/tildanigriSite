Of course, on the physical plane, a thought  is invisible and intangible, but it is no less real: in its own region and with  its own subtle matter, it is a living, active being. </div></td>

              <p>God has given the mightiest, most potent form of power  that exists to the spirit, and as every one of our thoughts is pregnant with  the power of the spirit which brought it into being, that power is constantly  at work. Knowing this, each one of you has the possibility of becoming a  benefactor of mankind: by projecting your thoughts into the farthest reaches of  space, you can send out messages of light to help, comfort, enlighten and heal  others. He, who undertakes this work knowingly and deliberately, gradually  penetrates into the mysterious arcana of divine creation.</p>
