            <p>We are  not in the habit of thinking of thoughts as living entities; there is no  mention of this in the official science we are taught; it is something that is completely  unknown. Only Initiatic Science has studied this question, and it teaches, not  only that thoughts are living entities, but that they are not actually created  by man.</p>

          <td colspan="2" class="style7"><div align="justify">They  can enter and dwell in man, to help or hinder him, but he does not create them  himself: he creates only the conditions they need to come and visit him. The  process is exactly the same as for children: a man and a woman do not create  their child, that is to say, his spirit; they only build his &quot;house&quot;, the  physical body in which his spirit dwells. And the &quot;house&quot; they build may be a  shack or a palace, depending on the materials they have managed to procure.</div></td>

              <p>So, man does not create his own thoughts; he simply  attracts some and repulses others, for the laws of attraction and repulsion  apply in this domain, as in so many others. If man created his own thoughts, he  would be able to get rid of them as easily as he brought them into being, but,  as you know from personal experience, that is not the case. How often a swarm  of thoughts have attacked you, like a cloud of angry wasps or mosquitoes, and  you have been unable to drive them away! Why? Because you have created the  conditions that attract them; the impurities that you have allowed to  accumulate in yourself attracts creatures that like that kind of dirt. But if  you purify yourself, you will soon see what kind of thoughts come to you.  Thoughts exist in every region and on every level of space, all the way to the  world of Ideas of which Plato spoke. What are Ideas? They are the eternal  Principles, the Archetypes, the Powers that are constantly at work forming and  fashioning the universe. They are divinities. Each Idea is a divinity. </p>
