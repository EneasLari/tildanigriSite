            <p>Yes,  this is something you should know: <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">when a human being dedicates his whole life to the light</a>, his  work becomes of decisive importance for the affairs of the world. Wherever he  may be and whether he be known or entirely unknown to the rest of the world, he  becomes a centre, a focal point of such power that nothing takes place without  his participation; he harmonizes all the forces of the universe in the  direction of one luminous goal; he even has a part in the decisions taken by  the spirits on high. Does this astonish you? There is no reason to be  astonished: it is quite normal.</p>

              <p>Why shouldn't the luminous spirits who watch over the  destiny of the world take into account the opinions of other spirits whose  radiations and emanations resemble their own? <br>
It would be neither logical nor just if nobody here on  earth were allowed a voice in decisions concerning the future of mankind.  Henceforth, you must know, first of all, that your voice can be heard when it  comes to deciding the destiny of the world and, secondly, how to take part in  the decision-making process on high. When you realize this, your life will take  on new meaning. You will understand more clearly how important it is to start  living a divine life that will earn you the right to make your voice heard in  the debates of the sublime entities on high.</p>

              <p>You will ask, &quot;But is a disciple aware that he has  this role?&quot; To begin with, no; but he can become aware of it. There is always  some part of him that participates, that is listened to and taken into  consideration, but this occurs in the highest spheres of his consciousness; his  ordinary, everyday awareness does not have access to this level. The physical  dimension is so dense and opaque that a great deal of time and effort is  necessary before events that occur in the Heavenly spheres are reflected and  perceived on earth. </p>
