            <p>All my life long I have been intent on one thing and  one thing only: how to help my fellow human beings. This is my one great  concern, my only preoccupation. I am well aware of the conditions in which they  live; indeed, I would have to be blind not to recognize all the difficulties  they have to face. But it is possible to overcome these difficulties; there are  a certain number of methods by means of which men and women can strengthen  their inner life and, if they are to avoid being destroyed by external  conditions, they must learn to use them. &nbsp; </p>

              <p>The goal of most oriental spiritual teachings is  liberation. For thousands of years, the Initiates of India, Tibet and Japan have worked to find methods which would enable them  to free themselves from the bonds holding them down to earth. This is why many  of them retired into caves or deep into the forest in order to devote  themselves wholly to this work of liberation. Personally, I do not like that  attitude much; it still seems rather selfish to me. Why try to free oneself? I  have no desire to be free, on the contrary, I want to limit myself and  consciously commit myself. If you are so intent on freeing yourself then, of  course, it only remains for you to walk out on everything and everyone: nothing  else matters. It must be fine to be free and to float in light, bliss and  ecstasy, to know the beatitude of Nirvana, but personally, I cannot see any  advantage in being happy all alone; that is not what I want. </p>

            <p>And that is why I have limited myself and committed  myself totally. I came down to earth because I thought it was selfish to stay  up there, in such freedom and happiness. I understood that it would be better  to come here and be knocked about and criticized and dirtied. </p>

              <p>It is  almost as though many of those who have completed their evolution on this  planet tired of all that joy and happiness, all that light. Even some of the  very greatest Initiates who have lived on earth seem unable to wipe out the  memory of that experience and sever their bonds with the earth. They are free, they  have been victorious in all their battles, they are living in eternity and yet,  from time to time, they feel the desire to gaze on those poor human beings  amongst whom they lived and with whom, in spite of the great distance between  them, they still feel a bond. Centuries, even millenaries after leaving the  earth, they still remember, and in the greatness, the abundance and the  tremendous love of their hearts, they decide to come down and help humanity.  And that is what I did.</p>
