      <p align="center" class="style3">The reason for the procreation of beings <br>
      is the lust for immortality</p>
      <p>"Because to the mortal  creature, generation is a sort of eternity and immortality," she replied; "and  if, as has been already admitted, love is of the everlasting possession of the  good, all men will necessarily desire immortality together with good: Wherefore <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">love is of immortality</a>". All this she taught me at various times when she spoke of love. And I  remember her once saying to me, "What is the cause, Socrates, of love, and the  attendant desire? See you not how all animals, birds, as well as beasts, in  their desire of procreation, are in agony when they take the infection of love,  which begins with the desire of union; whereto is added the care of offspring, on whose  behalf the weakest are ready to battle against the strongest even to the  uttermost, and to die for them, and will let themselves be tormented with  hunger or suffer anything in order to maintain their young. Man may be  supposed to act thus from reason; but why should animals have these passionate  feelings? Can you tell me why?" <br>
        <br>
Again I replied that I did not know. She said to me: <br>
"And do you expect ever to become a master in the art of love, if you do  not know this?" <br>
<br>
"But I have told you already, Diotima, that my ignorance is the reason  why I come to you; for I am conscious that I want a teacher; tell me then the  cause of this and of the other mysteries of love."<br>
<br>
"Marvel not," she said, "if you believe that love is of the immortal, as  we have several times acknowledged; for here again, and on the same principle  too, the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to be everlasting and  immortal: and this is only to be attained by generation, because generation always  leaves behind a new existence in the place of the old. Nay even in the life of  the same individual there is succession and not absolute unity: a man is called  the same, and yet in the short interval which elapses between youth and age,  and in which every animal is said to have life and identity, he is undergoing a  perpetual process of loss and reparation - hair, flesh, bones, blood,  and the whole body are always changing. Which is true not only of the body, but  also of the soul, whose habits, tempers, opinions, desires, pleasures, pains,  fears, never remain the same in any one of us, but are always coming and going;  and equally true of knowledge, and what is still more surprising to us mortals,  not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay, so that in respect of  them we are never the same; but each of them individually experiences a like  change. For what is implied in the word &quot;recollection,&quot; but the  departure of knowledge, which is ever being forgotten, and is renewed and  preserved by recollection, and appears to be the same although in reality new,  according to that law of succession by which all mortal things are preserved,  not absolutely the same, but by substitution, the old worn-out mortality  leaving another new and similar existence behind - unlike the divine, which is  always the same and not another? </p>
      And in this way, Socrates, the mortal body, or  mortal anything, partakes of immortality; but the immortal in another way. Marvel not then at the love which all men have  of their offspring; for that universal love and interest is for the sake of  immortality.
