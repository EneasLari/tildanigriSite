      <p align="center" class="style3">The soul departs for its like</p>
      <p>And is it likely that  the soul, which is invisible, in passing to the place of the true Hades, which  like her is invisible, and pure, and noble, and on her way to the good and wise  God, whither, if God will, my soul is also soon to go,--that the soul, I  repeat, if this be her nature and origin, will be blown away and destroyed <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">immediately on quitting the body</a>, as the many say? That can never be, my dear Simmias and Cebes. The truth rather is, that the soul which is pure at departing and draws after her no bodily taint, having never voluntarily during life had connection with the body, which she is ever avoiding, herself gathered into herself;--and making such abstraction her perpetual study--which means that she has been a true disciple of philosophy; and therefore has in fact been always engaged in the practice of dying? For is not philosophy the practice of death?--
Certainly.
That soul, I say, herself invisible, departs to the invisible world--to the divine and immortal and rational: thither arriving, she is secure of bliss and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and wild passions and all other human ills, and for ever dwells, as they say of the initiated, in company with the gods (compare Apol.). Is not this true, Cebes?

        <p>Yes,  said Cebes, beyond a doubt. </p>
        <p>But  the soul which has been polluted, and is impure at the time of her departure,  and is the companion and servant of the body always, and is in love with and  fascinated by the body and by the desires and pleasures of the body, until she  is led to believe that the truth only exists in a bodily form, which a man may  touch and see and taste, and use for the purposes of his lusts, the soul, I  mean, accustomed to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual principle, which  to the bodily eye is dark and invisible, and can be attained only by  philosophy;--do you suppose that such a soul will depart pure and unalloyed? </p>
        <p>Impossible,  he replied. </p>
        <p>She  is held fast by the corporeal, which the continual association and constant  care of the body have wrought into her nature. <br>
          Very  true. </p>
        And this corporeal element, my friend, is heavy and  weighty and earthy, and is that element of sight by which a soul is depressed  and dragged down again into the visible world, because she is afraid of the  invisible and of the world below prowling about tombs and sepulchres, near  which, as they tell us, are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which  have not departed pure, but are cloyed with sight and therefore visible.<br>
