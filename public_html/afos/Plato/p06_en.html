      <p align="center" class="style3">Souls are led to the place of their reincarnation and choose their new life </p>
      <p>When Er and the spirits  arrived, their duty was to go at once to Lachesis; but first of all there came  a prophet who arranged them in order; then he took from the knees of Lachesis <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">lots and samples of lives</a>, and having mounted a  high pulpit, spoke as follows:  </p>
      <p>"Hear the word of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls,  behold a new cycle of life and mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to  you, but you will choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot have  the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny. Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours  her he will have more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser -  God is justified." <br>
        <br>
        When the Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots  indifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which fell near  him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed), and each as he took his lot  perceived the number which he had obtained. Then the  Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives; and there  were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of all sorts. There  were lives of every animal and of man in every condition. And there were  tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant's life, others which broke  off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary; and  there were lives of famous men, some who were famous for their form and beauty  as well as for their strength and success in games, or, again, for their birth  and the qualities of their ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous  for the opposite qualities. And of women likewise; there was not, however, any  definite character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new life, must of  necessity become different. But there was every other quality, and the all mingled  with one another, and also with elements of wealth and poverty, and disease and  health; and there were mean states also.<br>
