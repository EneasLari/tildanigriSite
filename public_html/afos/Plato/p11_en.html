      <p align="center" class="style3">The divine origin of poetic inspiration - <br>
      the phenomenon of hyper-coverage</p>
      <p>I perceive, Ion; and I will proceed to explain  to&nbsp; you what I&nbsp; imagine to be the reason of this. The gift which you possess of speaking excellently about Homer is not an  art, but, as I was just saying, an inspiration; <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">there is a divinity moving you</a>, like that contained in the stone which Euripides calls a magnet, but  which is commonly known as the stone of Heraclea.  This stone not only attracts iron rings, but also imparts to them a similar  power of attracting other rings; and sometimes you may see a number of pieces  of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a long chain:  and all of them derive their power of suspension from the original  stone. In like manner the Muse first of all inspires men herself; and from  these inspired persons a chain of other persons is suspended, who take the  inspiration. For all  good poets, epic as well as lyric, compose their beautiful poems not by art,  but because they are inspired and possessed. And as the  Corybantian revellers when they dance are not in their right mind, so the lyric  poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their beautiful  strains: but when falling under the power of music and metre they are inspired  and possessed; like Bacchic maidens who draw milk and honey from the rivers  when they are under the influence of Dionysus but not when they are in their  right mind. And the soul  of the lyric poet does the same,&nbsp; as they  themselves say; for they tell us that they bring songs from honeyed fountains,  culling them out of the gardens and dells of the Muses; they, like the bees,  winging their way from flower to flower. And this is true. For the poet is a  light and winged and holy thing, and there is no invention in him until he has  been inspired and is out of his senses, and the mind is no longer in him: when  he has not attained to this state, he is powerless and is unable to utter  his&nbsp; oracles. Many are the  noble words in which poets speak concerning the&nbsp;  actions of men; but like yourself when speaking about Homer, they do not  speak of them by any rules of art:&nbsp; they are simply inspired to utter that&nbsp; to which the Muse impels them, and that only;  and when inspired, one of&nbsp; them will make  dithyrambs, another hymns of praise, another choral strains, another epic or  iambic verses - and he who is good at one is not good at any other kind of  verse: for not by art does the poet sing, but by power divine. Had he learned  by rules of&nbsp; art, he would have known how  to speak not of one theme only, but of all; and therefore God takes away the  minds of poets, and uses them as his ministers, as he also uses diviners and  holy prophets, in order that we who hear them may know them to be speaking not  of themselves who utter these priceless words in a state of&nbsp; unconsciousness, but&nbsp; that God himself is the speaker, and that  through them he is conversing with us.(...) For in this way the God would seem  to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems&nbsp; are not human, or the work of man,&nbsp; but divine and the work of God; and that the  poets are only the&nbsp; interpreters of the  Gods by whom they are severally possessed. Was not this the lesson which the  God intended to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best  of songs?</p>
