      <p align="center" class="style3">Ardiaeus'  punishment <br>
      for his abominable crimes</p>
      <p>He mentioned that he was  present when one of the spirits asked another, "Where is Ardiaeus the Great?"  (Now this Ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been  the tyrant of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother, and was said  to have committed many other abominable crimes.) The answer of the other spirit  was:  &quot;<a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">He comes not hither and will never come</a>. And this,&quot; said he, &quot;was one of the dreadful sights which we  ourselves witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having completed  all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden Ardiaeus appeared  and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and there were also besides the  tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals: they were just, as  they fancied, about to return into the upper world, but the mouth, instead of  admitting them, gave a roar, whenever any of these incurable sinners or some  one who had not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend;&nbsp; and then wild men of fiery aspect, who were  standing &nbsp;by and heard the sound, seized and carried  them off; and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand, and threw  them down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them along the road at the  side, carding them on thorns like wool, and declaring to the passers-by what  were their crimes, and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell. And of all the many terrors which they had endured, he said that there  was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment, lest they  should hear the voice;&nbsp; and when there  was silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding joy. These, said Er, were the penalties and retributions, and there were  blessings as great. <br />
