      <p align="center" class="style3">Athenians should not be deprived of their &quot;gadfly&quot; - a Voice which comes to me</p>
      <p>Men of Athens, do not interrupt, but hear me; there was an  agreement between us that you should hear me out. And I think  that what I am going to say will do you good: for I have something more to say,  at which you may be inclined to cry out; but I beg that you will not do this. I  would have you know that, if you kill such a one as I am, you will injure  yourselves more than you will injure me. Meletus and Anytus will not injure me:  they cannot; for it is not in the nature of things that a bad man should injure  a better than himself. I do not  deny that he may, perhaps, kill him, or drive him into exile, or deprive him of  civil rights; and he may imagine, and others may imagine, that he is doing him  a great injury: but in that I do not agree with him; for the evil of doing as  Anytus is doing - of unjustly taking away another man's life - is  greater far. And now, Athenians, I am not going to argue for my own sake, as you may  think, but for yours, that you may not sin against the God, or lightly reject  his boon by condemning me. For if you kill me you will not easily find another  like me, who, if I may use such a ludicrous figure of speech, am a sort of  gadfly, given to the state by the God; and the state is like a great and noble  steed who is tardy in his motions owing to his very size, and requires to be  stirred into life. I am that gadfly which  God has given the state and all day long and in all places am always fastening  upon you, arousing and persuading and reproaching you. And as you  will not easily find another like me, I would advise you to spare me. I dare  say that you may feel irritated at being suddenly awakened when you are caught  napping; and you may think that if you were to strike me dead, as Anytus  advises, which you easily might, then you would sleep on for the remainder of  your lives, unless God in his care of you gives you another gadfly. And that I am given to you by God is proved by this:  -  that if I had been like other men, I should not have neglected all my own  concerns, or patiently seen the neglect of them during all these years, and  have been doing yours, coming to you individually, like a father or elder  brother, exhorting you to regard virtue; this I say, would not be like human  nature. And had I gained anything, or if my exhortations had been paid, there  would have been some sense in that: but now, as you will perceive, not even the  impudence of my accusers dares to say that I have ever exacted or sought pay of  anyone; they have no witness of that. And I have a witness of the truth of what  I say; my poverty is a sufficient witness. 
      Someone may wonder why I  go about in private, giving advice and busying myself with the concerns of  others, but do not venture to come forward in public and advise the state. I will tell you the reason of this. You have  often heard me speak of an <a href="javasript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">oracle or sign which comes to me</a>, and is the divinity which  Meletus ridicules in the indictment. This sign I have had ever since I was a  child. The sign is a voice which comes to me and always forbids me to do  something which I am going to do, but never commands me to do anything, and  this is what stands in the way of my being a politician. And rightly, as I  think. For I am certain, O men of Athens, that if I had engaged in politics, I  should have perished long ago and done no good either to you or to myself. <br>
