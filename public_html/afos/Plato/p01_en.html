      The world is an intelligible living being, <br>
      complete and unique</p>
      <p><br />
      Now it is all-important  that the beginning of everything should be according to nature. And in speaking of the copy and the original we may assume&nbsp; that words are akin to the matter which they  describe; when they&nbsp; relate to the  lasting and permanent and intelligible, they ought to be lasting and  unalterable, and, as far as their nature allows, irrefutable and  immovable--nothing less. But when they express only <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">the copy or likeness</a>, and not the eternal  things themselves, they need only be likely and analogous to the real words. As being is to becoming, so is truth to belief.&nbsp; If then, Socrates, amid the many opinions  about the gods and the generation of the universe, we are not able to give  notions which are altogether and in every respect exact&nbsp; and consistent with one another, do not be  surprised.&nbsp; Enough, if we adduce probabilities as likely as any others; for we must  remember that I who am the speaker, and you who are the judges, are only mortal  men, and we ought to accept the tale which&nbsp;  is probable and enquire no&nbsp;  further. </p>
      <p>SOCRATES:  Excellent, Timaeus; and we will do precisely as you bid us. The  prelude is charming, and is already accepted by us - may  we beg of you to proceed to the strain? </p>
      <p><br />
      TIMAEUS: Let me tell you  then why the creator made this world of&nbsp; generation. He was good, and the good can never have  any jealousy of&nbsp; anything. And being free from jealousy, he desired that all things should&nbsp; be as like himself as they could be. This is  in the&nbsp; truest sense the origin of  creation and of the world, as we shall do well in believing on the testimony of  wise men: God desired that all things should be good and nothing bad, so far as  this was attainable. Wherefore  also finding the whole visible sphere not at rest, but moving in an irregular  and disorderly fashion, out of disorder he brought order, considering that this  was in every way better than the other.&nbsp; Now the deeds of the best could never be or have been other than the  fairest; and the creator, reflecting on the things which are by nature visible,  found that no unintelligent creature taken as a whole was fairer than the  intelligent taken as a whole; and that&nbsp;  intelligence could not be present in anything which was devoid of soul.  For which reason, when he was framing the universe, he put intelligence in  soul, and soul in body, that he might be the creator of a work which was by  nature fairest and best. Wherefore, using the language of probability, we may  say that the world became a living creature truly endowed with soul and  intelligence by the providence of God. </p>
      <p><br />
      This being supposed, let  us proceed to the next stage: In the likeness of what animal did the Creator  make the world? It would be an unworthy thing to liken it to any  nature which exists as a part only; for nothing can be beautiful which is like  any imperfect thing; but let us suppose the world&nbsp; to be the very image of that whole of which  all other animals both individually and in their tribes are portions. For the  original of the universe contains in itself all intelligible beings, just as  this world comprehends us and all other visible creatures. For the Deity,  intending to make this world like the fairest and most perfect of intelligible  beings, framed one visible animal comprehending within itself all other animals  of a kindred nature. Are we right in saying that there is one world, or that  they are many and infinite? There must be one only, if the created copy is to  accord with the original. For  that which includes all other intelligible creatures cannot have a second or  companion; in&nbsp; that&nbsp; case there would be need of another living  being which would&nbsp; include both,&nbsp; and of which they would be parts, and the  likeness would be more truly said to resemble not them, but that other which  included&nbsp; them. In order then that the world might be solitary, like the&nbsp; perfect animal, the creator made not two  worlds or an infinite number of them; but there is and ever will be one  only-begotten and created heaven.</p>
