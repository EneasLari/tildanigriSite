      <p align="center" class="style3">Socrates' comments on his Sentence</p>
      <p>But the oracle made no sign of opposition, either as I was leaving my  house and going out in the morning, or when I was going up into this court, or  while I was speaking, at anything which I was going to say; and yet I have  often been stopped in the middle of a speech; but now in nothing I either said  or did touching this matter has the oracle opposed me. What do I take to be the  explanation of this? I will tell you. I regard this as a proof that what has  happened to me is a good, and that those of us who think that death is an evil  are in error. <br>
        <br>
This is a great proof to me of what I am saying, for the customary sign  would surely have opposed me had I been going to evil and not to good. Let us  reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great reason to hope  that death is a good, for one of two things: - either death is a state of  nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and  migration of the soul from this world to another. Now if you suppose that there  is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even  by the sight of dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. <br>
<br>
For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was  undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the other days and  nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had  passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I  think that any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king, will  not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. <br>
Now if death is like this, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is  then only a single night. But if death is the journey to another place, and  there, as men say, all the dead are, what good, O my friends and judges, can be  greater than this?<br>
<br>
If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world  below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in this world, and finds  the true judges who are said to give judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus and  Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous in their own  life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What would not a man give if he  might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be  true, let me die again and again. I, too, shall have a wonderful interest in a  place where I can converse with Palamedes, and Ajax the son of Telamon, and other heroes of old, who  have suffered death through an unjust judgment; and there will be no small  pleasure, as I think, in comparing my own sufferings with theirs. Above all, I  shall be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this  world, so also in that; I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be  wise, and is not. What would not a man give, O judges, to be able to examine  the leader of the great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus or Sisyphus, or  numberless others, men and women too! What infinite delight would there be in  conversing with them and asking them questions! For in that world they do not  put a man to death for this; certainly not. For besides being happier in that  world than in this, they will be immortal, if what is said is true. <br>
Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death,  and know this of a truth - that no evil can happen to a good man, either in  life or after death. He and his are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own  approaching end happened by mere chance. But I see clearly that to die and be  released was better for me; and therefore the oracle gave no sign. For which  reason also, I am not angry with my accusers, or my condemners; they have done  me no harm, although neither of them meant to do me any good; and for this I  may gently blame them. <br>
<br>
Still I have a favor to ask of them. When my sons  are grown up, I would ask you, O my friends, to punish them; and I would have  you trouble them, as I have troubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or  anything, more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something when they  are really nothing, - then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring  about that for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something  when they are really nothing. And if you do this, I and my sons will have  received justice at your hands. <br>
<br>
The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our  ways - I to die, and you to live. Which is better God only knows. <br>
