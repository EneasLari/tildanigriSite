      <p align="center" class="style3">Education,  the movement of the soul <br>
      towards Good</p>
      <p>Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the  eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the  light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's eye, quite as  much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose  vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask  whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter life, and is unable to  see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day  is dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in  his condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a  mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light, there will be  more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above  out of the light into the den. <br>
        <br>
That, he said, is a very  just distinction.<br>
<br>
        But then, if I am right,  certain professors of education must be wrong when they say that they can put a  knowledge into the soul which was not there before, like sight into blind eyes. <br>
        <br>
        They undoubtedly say  this, he replied. <br>
        <br>
      Whereas, our argument  shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already;&nbsp; and that just as the eye was unable to turn  from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of knowledge  can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming  into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being, and of  the brightest and best of being, or in other words, of the good. </p>
      <p>Very true. <br>
        <br>
        And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the  easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for that  exists already, but has been turned  in the wrong direction, and is looking away from the truth?</p>
