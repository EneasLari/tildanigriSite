      and devoted to the same God</strong></p>
      <p>Simmias  said: I must confess, Socrates, that doubts did arise in our minds, and each of  us was urging and inciting the other to put the question which we wanted to  have answered and which neither of us liked to ask, fearing that our  importunity might be troublesome under present at such a time. </p>
      Socrates replied with a  smile: O Simmias, what are you saying? I am not very likely to persuade other men that I do  not regard my present situation as a misfortune, if I cannot even persuade you  that I am no worse off now than at any other time in my life. Will you not  allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans? For  they, when they perceive that they must die, having sung all their life long,  do then sing more lustily than ever, rejoicing in the thought that they are  about to go away to the god whose ministers they are. But men, because they are  themselves afraid of death, slanderously affirm of the swans that they sing a  lament at the last, not considering that no bird sings when cold, or hungry, or  in pain, not even the nightingale, nor the swallow, nor yet the hoopoe; which  are said indeed to tune a lay of sorrow, although I do not believe this to be  true of them any more than of the swans. But because they are sacred to Apollo,  they have the gift of prophecy, and anticipate the good things of another  world, wherefore they sing and rejoice in that day more than they ever did  before. And I too, believing  myself to be the consecrated servant of the same God, and the fellow-servant of  the swans, and thinking that I have received from my master gifts of prophecy  which are not inferior to theirs, would not go out of life less merrily than  the swans. Never mind then, if this  be your only objection, but speak and ask anything which you like, while the  eleven magistrates of Athens allow.<br>
