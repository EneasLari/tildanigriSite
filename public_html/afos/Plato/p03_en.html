      <p align="center">What Er, the son of Armenius recounted <br>
      after his  return to life</p>
      <p>And yet, I said, all  these are as nothing either in number or greatness in comparison with those  other recompenses which await both just and unjust after death. And you ought  to hear them, and then both just and unjust will have received from us a full  payment of the debt which the argument owes to them. </p>
      <p>Speak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly hear. </p>
      Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of  the tales which Odysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of  a hero, Er the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle, and ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the  dead were taken up already in a state of corruption, his body was found  unaffected by decay, and carried away home to be buried.&nbsp; And on  the twelfth day, as he was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and  told them what he had seen in the other world. He said  that
      <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')"> when his soul left the body</a> he went on a journey with a great company, and that  they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the  earth;&nbsp; they were near together, and over  against them were two other openings in the heaven above. In the intermediate space there were judges seated,  who commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them and had bound  their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the heavenly way on the right  hand; and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower  way on the left hand; these also bore the  symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs. He drew near, and they told him that he was to be the messenger who  would carry the report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and  see all that was to be heard and seen in that place. Then he beheld and saw on  one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when  sentence had been given on them;&nbsp; and at  the two other openings other souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and  worn with travel, some descending out of heaven clean and bright. And arriving  ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey, and they went forth  with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped as at a festival; and those  who knew one another embraced and conversed, the souls which came from earth curiously  enquiring about the things above, and the souls which came from heaven about  the things beneath. And they told one another of what had happened by the way,  those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which  they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth (now the journey  lasted a thousand years), while those from above were describing heavenly  delights and visions of inconceivable beauty. The story, Glaucon, would take  too long to tell;&nbsp; but the sum was this:  - He said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they  suffered tenfold;&nbsp; or once in a hundred  years - such being reckoned to be the length of man's life, and the penalty  being thus paid ten times in a thousand years.&nbsp;  If, for example, there were any who had been the  cause of many deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been  guilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences they  received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence and justice  and holiness were in the same proportion. I need  hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as  they were born. Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of murderers,  there were retributions other and greater far which he described.<br />
