              <p>Now I realize the state of my own mind; I see that it  is the instrument of sensation and desire, or rather that <strong>it is</strong> sensation and desire, and that it is mechanically caught up  in routine. Such a mind is incapable of ever receiving or feeling out the new;  for the new must obviously be something beyond sensation, which is always the  old. So, this mechanical process with its sensations has to come to and end,  has it not? The wanting more, the pursuit of symbols, words, images, with their  sensation - all that has to come to an end. </p>

              <p>Only then is it possible for the mind to be in that  state of creativeness in which the new can always come into being. If you will  understand without being mesmerized by words, by habits, by ideas, and see how  important it is to have the new constantly impinging on the mind, then,  perhaps, you will understand the process of desire, the routine, the boredom,  the constant craving for experience. Then I think you will begin to see that  desire has very little significance in life for a man who is really seeking.<br>

            <p>Obviously there are certain physical needs: food,  clothing, shelter, and all the rest of it. But they never become psychological  appetites, things on which the mind builds itself as a centre of desire. Beyond  the physical needs, <strong>any</strong> form of  desire - for greatness, for truth, for virtue - becomes a psychological process  by which the mind builds the idea of the "me" and strengthens itself at the  centre.</p>

              <p>When you see this process, when you are really aware  of it without opposition, without a sense of temptation, without resistance,  without justifying or judging it, then you will discover that the mind is  capable of receiving the new and that the new is never a sensation; therefore  it can never be recognized, re-experienced. It is a state of being in which  creativeness comes without invitation, without memory; and that is reality.</p>
