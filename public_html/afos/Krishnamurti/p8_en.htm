              What  is important, surely, <a href="#" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">to be aware without choice</a>, because  choice brings about conflict. The chooser is in confusion, therefore he  chooses; if he is not in confusion, there is no choice. Only the person who is  confused chooses what he shall do or shall not do. The man who is clear and  simple does not choose; what is, is. Action based on an idea is obviously the  action of choice and such action is not liberating; on the contrary, it only  creates further resistance, further conflict, according to that conditioned  thinking.</p>

              <p>The important thing, therefore, is to be aware from  moment to moment without accumulating the experience which awareness brings;  because, the moment you accumulate, you are aware only according to that  accumulation, according to that pattern, according to that experience. That is  your awareness is conditioned by your accumulation and therefore there is no  longer observation but merely translation. Where there is translation, there is  choice, and choice creates conflict; in conflict there can be no understanding.</p>

As I said, this  passive awareness does not come through any form of discipline, through any  practice. It is to be just aware, from moment to moment, of our thinking and  feeling, not only when we are awake; for we shall see, as we go into it more  deeply, that we begin to dream, that we begin to throw up all kinds of symbols  which we translate as dreams. Thus we open the door into the hidden, which  becomes the known; but to find the unknown, we must go beyond the door -  surely, that is our difficulty. Reality is not a thing which is knowable by the  mind, because the mind is the result of the known, of the past; therefore the  mind must understand itself and its functioning, its truth, and only then is it  possible for the unknown <strong>to be.</strong></p>
