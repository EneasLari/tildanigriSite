              <p>It was one of those lovely mornings that have never  been before. The sun was just coming up and you saw it between the eucalyptus  and the pine. It was over the waters, golden, burnished - such light that  exists only between the mountains and the sea. <br>
                <br>
It was such a clear morning, breathless, full of that  strange light that one sees not only with one's eyes but with one's heart. And  when you see it the heavens are very close to earth, and you are lost in the  beauty. </p>

              <p>You know, you should never meditate in public, or with  another, or in a group; you should meditate only in solitude, in the quiet of  the night or in the still, early morning. When you meditate in solitude, it  must be solitude. You must be completely alone, not following a system, a  method, repeating words, pursuing a thought, or shaping a thought according to  your desire. <br>
                <br>
This solitude comes when the mind is freed from  thought. When there are influences of desire or of the things that the mind is  pursuing, either in the future or in the past, there is no solitude. </p>

            <p>Only in the immensity of the present this aloneness  comes. And then in quiet secrecy in which all communication has come to an end,  in which there is no observer with his anxieties, with his stupid appetites and  problems - only then, in that quiet aloneness, meditation becomes something  that cannot be put into words. Then meditation is an eternal movement.</p>

              <p>I don't know if you have ever meditated, if you have  ever been alone, by yourself, far away from everything, from every person, from  every thought and pursuit, if you have ever been completely alone, not  isolated, not withdrawn into some fanciful dream or vision, but far away, so  that in yourself there is nothing recognizable, nothing that you touch by thought  or feeling, so far away that in the full solitude the very silence becomes the  only flower, the only light, and the timeless quality that is not measurable by  thought. Only in such meditation love has its being. Don't bother to express  it; it will express itself. Don't use it. Don't try to put it into action; it  will act, and when it acts, in that action will be no regret, no contradiction,  none of the misery and travail of man. <br>

              <p>So meditate alone. Get lost. And don't try to remember  where you have been. If you try to remember it, then it will be something that  is dead. And if you hold on to the memory of it, then you will never be alone  again. So meditate in that endless solitude, in the beauty of that love, in  that innocence, in the new - then there is the bliss that is imperishable. <br>
                <br>
The sky is very blue, the blue that comes after the  rain, and these rains have come after many months of drought. <br>

              <br>
So meditate in the very secret recesses of your heart  and mind, where you have never been before.</p>
