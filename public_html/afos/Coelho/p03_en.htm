                &quot;The story had been transmitted  from generation to generation so that no one would ever forget: sometimes <em>it was necessary to struggle with God</em>.  Every human being at some time had tragedy enter his life; it might be the  destruction of a city, the death of a son, an unproved accusation, a sickness  that left one lame forever. At that moment, God challenged one to confront Him  and to answer His question: "Why dost thou cling fast to an existence so short  and so filled with suffering? What is the meaning of thy struggle?&quot;<br>
                <br>
                The man who did not know how  to answer this question would resign himself, while another, one who sought a  meaning to existence, feeling that God had been unjust, would challenge his own  destiny. It was at this moment that fire of a different type descended from the  heavens-not the fire that kills but the kind that tears down ancient walls and  imparts to each human being his true possibilities. Cowards never allow their  hearts to blaze with this fire; all they desire is for the changed situation to  quickly return to what it was before, so they can go on living their lives and  thinking in their customary way. The brave, however, set afire that which was  old and, even at the cost of great internal suffering, abandon everything,  including God, and continue onward.<br>
                <br>
                The brave are always stubborn.<br>
                <br>
                From heaven, God smiles  contentedly, for it was this that He desired, that each person take into his  hands the responsibility for his own life. For, in the final analysis, He had  given His children the greatest of all gifts: the capacity to choose and determine  their arts.<br>
                <br>
                Only those men and women with  the sacred flame in their hearts had the courage to confront Him. And they  alone knew the path back to His love, for they understood that tragedy was not  punishment but challenge&quot;.</p>
