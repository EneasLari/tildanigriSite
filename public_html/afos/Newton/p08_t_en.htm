It is my custom to ask  subjects if they see feel a discarnate presence in the room. If they do, this  third party is usually a protective guide. Often, a client will sense the  presence of a discarnate figure before visualizing a face or  hearing a voice. People who meditate a great deal are  naturally more familiar with these visions than someone who  never called upon his or her guide. </div></td>

              of the  continuity of life and our identity as a soul. Guides are figures of grace in  our 
              existence  because they are part of the fulfillment of our destiny. </div></td>

level  of the soul determines to some extent the degree of advancement of the guide 
assigned  to them. In fact, the maturity of a particular guide also has a bearing on 
whether  these teachers have only one student or many under their direction. Guides 
at the  senior level of ability and above usually work with an entire group of souls in 
the  spirit world and on earth. These guides have other entities who assist them. 
From  what I can see, every soul group usually has one or more rather new teachers 
in  training. As a result, some people may have more than one guide helping them. </div></td>

It is a relief for many  people to learn their inner voices are not the hallucinations associated with  the mentally ill. Rather than something to be worried about, an inner voice is  like having your own resident counselor on call. More often than not, these  voices are those of our guides. </p>           </td>
