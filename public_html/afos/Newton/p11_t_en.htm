            <p>I had been questioning Thece for quite a while and I could see she was  growing tired.  Few subjects can sustain this level of spiritual receptivity for very long. I decided to end the session  with a few questions about the genesis of all creation. </p>
            <p><b>Dr. N:</b> Thece, I want to close by asking you more  about the source. You have been a soul for a long time, so how do  you see yourself relating to the oneness of creation you told me  about earlier? <br>
              <br>
              <b>S:</b> (long pause) By sensations of movement. In the  beginning there is an outward migration of our soul energy from  the source. Afterward, our lives are spent moving inward ...  toward cohesion and the uniting ... </p>
            <p><b>Dr. N:</b> You make this process seem as though a  living organism was expanding and contracting. </p>
            <p><b>S:</b> ... There is an explosive release ... then a returning ... yes, the source  pulsates. </p>
            <b>Dr. N:</b> And you are moving toward the center of this energy source? </div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="481"><p><b>S:</b> There really is no center. The source is all around us as if we were ... inside  a beating  heart. </p>
            <p><b>Dr. N:</b> But, you did say you were moving back to a  point of origin as your soul advanced in knowledge? <br>
                <br>
                <b>S:</b> Yes, when I was thrust outward I was a child. Now  I'm being drawn back as my adolescence fades ... </p>
          <b>Dr. N:</b> Back where?</td>

        <tr>
          <td><p><b>S:</b> Further inside the source. </p>
            <p><b>Dr. N:</b> Perhaps you could describe this energy  source through the use of colors to explain soul movement and the  scope of creation. </p>
          <b>S:</b> (sighs) It's as if souls are all part of a massive electrical explosion which  produces ...&nbsp; a&nbsp; halo effect. In this ... circular halo is a  dark purple light which flares out ... lightening to a whiteness at  the edges. Our awareness begins at the edges of brilliant light and as we grow ... we  become more engulfed in the darker light.</td>

                <br>
                <b>S:</b> That's because I am not close enough to  conjunction to explain it well. The dark light is itself  a&nbsp; ... covering, beyond which we feel an  intense warmth ... full of a knowing presence which is  everywhere for us and ... alive! </p>
            <b>Dr. N:</b> What was it like when you were first aware of your identity as a soul after being pushed out to the rim of  this halo?</div></td>

          <td><p align="justify"><b>S:</b> To be ... is the same as watching the first  flower of spring open and the flower is you. And, as it  opens more, you become aware of other flowers in a glorious field and  there is ... unbounded joy. </p>

            <p><b>S:</b> Nothing is collapsing ... the source is  endless. As souls we will never die - we know that, somehow. As we coalesce, our  increasing wisdom makes the source stronger. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Dr. N:</b> Is that the reason the source desires to  perform this exercise? </p>
            <p><b>S:</b> Yes, to give life to us so we can arrive at a  state of perfection. </p>
            <b>Dr. N:</b> Why does a source, who is ostensibly perfect already, need to create further intelligence which is less  than perfect?</div></td>

              <br>
              <b>Dr. N:</b> Were souls forced to break away from the  source and come to places like Earth because of some sort of  original sin or fall from grace in the spirit world? </p>
            <p align="justify"><b>S:</b> That's nonsense. We came to be ...  magnified&nbsp; ... in the beautiful variety  of creation. </p>
            <div align="justify"><b>Dr. N:</b> Thece, I want you to listen to me carefully. If the source needs to be made 
              stronger,  or more wise, by using a division of its divine energy to create lesser 
              intelligence  which it hopes will magnify - doesn't this suggest it lacks full perfection 
          itself?</div></td>

            <p><b>S:</b> (pause) The source creates for fulfillment of itself. </p>
            <p><b>Dr. N:</b> That's my point. How can that which is  absolute become more absolute unless something is lacking? <br>
                <br>
                <b>S:</b> (hesitates) That which we see to be ... our  source ... is all we can know, and we think what the creator  desires is to <em>express</em> itself through us by ... birthing. </p>
            <p><b>Dr. N:</b> And do you think the source is actually  made stronger by our existence as souls? </p>
            <p><b>S:</b>� (long  pause) I see the creator's perfection�  ... maintained and enriched ... by 
              sharing the possibility of perfection with us and this is the ultimate  extension of 
              itself. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Dr.&nbsp; N:</strong> So  the source starts&nbsp; out&nbsp; by&nbsp;  deliberately&nbsp; creating&nbsp; imperfect&nbsp;  souls&nbsp; and 
              imperfect life forms for these souls and watches what happens in order  to extend 
              itself? </p>
            <b>S:</b> Yes, and we have to have faith in this decision and trust the process of  returning to the  origin of life.&nbsp; One has to be starving  to appreciate food, to be cold to understand the blessings of warmth, and to be  children to see the value of the parent. The transformation gives us purpose.</div></td>

            <p><b>Dr. N:</b> If our spirits did not experience physical  life, would we ever know of these things you are telling me about? </p>
            <p><b>S:</b> We would know of them, but not about them. It would be as if your spiritual energy  were told to play piano scales with only one note. </p>
            <p><b>Dr. N:</b> And do you believe if the source didn't  create souls to nurture and grow, its sublime energy would shrink  from a lack of expression? </p>
