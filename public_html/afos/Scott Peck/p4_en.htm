            <p> (...) The  most striking feature of the process of physical evolution is that it is a  miracle. Given what we understand of the universe, evolution should not occur;  the phenomenon should not exist at all. One of the basic natural laws is the  second law of thermodynamics, which states that energy naturally flows from a  state of greater organization to a state of lesser organization, from a state  of higher differentiation to a state of lower differentiation. In other words,  the universe is in a process of winding down.</p>

          <td colspan="2" class="style1"><div align="justify">
            <p>The  example frequently used to describe this process is that of a stream, which  naturally flows downhill. It takes energy or work - pumps, locks, humans  carrying buckets, or other means - to reverse this process, to get back to the  beginning, to put the water back on top of the hill. And this energy has to  come from somewhere else. Some other energy system has to be depleted if this  one is to be maintained. Ultimately, according to the second law of  thermodynamics, in billions and billions of years, the universe will completely  wind down until it reaches the lowest point as an amorphous, totally  disorganized, totally undifferentiated 'blob' in which nothing happens any more. <strong><em>This  state of total disorganization and undifferentiation is termed entropy</em></strong><em>.</em></p>

              <p>The  natural downhill flow of energy toward the state of entropy might be termed the  force of entropy. We can now realize that the 'flow' of evolution is against  the force of entropy. The process of evolution has been a development of  organisms from lower to higher and higher states of complexity, differentiation  and organization. A virus is an extremely simple organism, little more than a  molecule. A bacterium is more complex, more differentiated, possessing a cell  wall and different types of molecules and a metabolism.</p>

            <p>A paramecium  has a nucleus, cilia, and a rudimentary digestive system. A sponge not only has  cells but begins to have different types of cells interdependent upon each  other. Insects and fish have nervous systems with complex methods of locomotion,  and even social organizations.</p>

              <p>And so  it goes, up the scale of evolution, a scale of increasing complexity and  organization and differentiation, with man, who possesses an enormous cerebral  cortex and extraordinarily complex behavior patterns, being, as far as we can  tell, at the top. I state that the process of evolution is a miracle, because  insofar as it is a counter to natural law. In the ordinary course of things, we  who write and read this book should not exist.</p>
              <p>The  process of evolution can be diagrammed by a pyramid, with man, the most complex  but least numerous organism, at the apex, and viruses, the most numerous but  least complex organisms, at the base:</p>

                <p>Again  and again I have emphasized that the process of spiritual growth is an  effortful and difficult one. This is because it is conducted against a natural  resistance, against a natural inclination to keep things the way they were, to  cling to the old maps and old ways of doing things, to take the easy path.

              <p>But  what is this force that pushes us an individuals and as a whole species to grow  against the natural resistance of our own lethargy? We have already labeled it. It  is love. When we grow, it  is because we are working at it, and we are working at it because we love  ourselves. It is through love that we elevate ourselves. And it is through our  love for others that we assist others to elevate themselves. Love, the  extension of the self, is the very act of evolution. It is evolution in  progress. The evolutionary force, present in all of life, manifests itself in  mankind as human love. Among humanity love is the miraculous force that defies  the natural law of entropy. </p>
