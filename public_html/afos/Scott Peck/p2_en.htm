            <p>I have said that  love is an action, an activity. This leads to the final major  misconception of love which needs to be addressed. Love is not a feeling. Many, many people  possessing a feeling of love and even acting in response to that feeling act in  all manner of unloving and destructive ways. On the other hand,  a genuinely loving individual will often take loving and constructive action  toward a person he or she consciously dislikes, actually feeling no love toward  the person at the time and perhaps even finding the person repugnant in some  way.</p>

              <p>The feeling of  love is the emotion that accompanies the experience of cathecting. Cathecting,  it will be remembered, is the process by which an object becomes important to  us. Once cathected, the  object, commonly referred to as a 'love object', is invested with our energy as  if it were a part of ourselves, and this relationship between us and the  invested object is called a cathexis. Since we may have many such relationships  going on at the same time, we speak of our cathexes. The process of withdrawing  our energy from a love object so that it loses its sense of importance for us  is known as decathecting. The misconception that love is a feeling exists  because we confuse cathecting with loving. (...)</p>

              <p>It  is clear that there may be a self-serving quality in this tendency to confuse  love with the feeling of love; it is easy and not at all unpleasant to find  evidence of love in one's feelings. It may be difficult and painful to search  for evidence of love in one's actions. But because true love is an act of will  that often transcends ephemeral feelings of love or cathexis, it is correct to  say, 'Love is as love does'. Love and nonlove, as good and evil, are objective  and not purely subjective phenomena.</p>
