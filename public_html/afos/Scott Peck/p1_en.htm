This  section will examine what lies in back of discipline - what provides the  motive, the energy for discipline. This force I believe  <a href="#" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">to be love</a>. I am very conscious of the fact that in attempting to examine love we  will be beginning to toy with mystery. In a very real sense we will be attempting to  examine the unexaminable and to know the unknowable. Love is too large, too  deep ever to be truly understood or measured or limited within the framework of  words. I would not write this if I did not believe the attempt to have value,  but no matter how valuable, I begin with the certain knowledge that the attempt  will be in some ways inadequate.</p>          </td>

            <p>One  result of the mysterious nature of love is that no one has ever, to my  knowledge, arrived at a truly satisfactory definition of love. In an  effort to explain it, therefore, love has been divided into various categories:  eros, philia, agape; perfect love and imperfect love, and so on. I am presuming, however, to give a single  definition of love, again with the awareness that it is likely to be in some  way or ways inadequate. <strong><em>I define love thus: The will to extend one's self for  the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth.</em></strong> </p>

              <p>At the outset I  would like to comment briefly on this definition before proceeding to a more  thorough elaboration. First, it may be noticed that it is a teleological  definition; the behavior is defined in terms of the goal or purpose it seems to  serve - in this case, spiritual growth. Scientists  tend to hold teleological definitions suspect, and perhaps they will this one.  I did not arrive at it, however, through a clearly teleological process of  thinking. Instead I arrived at it through observation in my clinical practice  of psychiatry (which includes self-observation), in which the definition of  love is a matter of considerable import. This is because patients are generally  very confused as to the nature of love. </p>

              <p>For instance, a  timid young man reported to me: &quot;My mother loved me so much she wouldn't let me  take the school bus to school until my senior year in high school. Even then I had to beg her to let me go. I  guess she was afraid that I would get hurt, so she drove me to and from school  every day, which was very hard on her. She really loved  me.&quot;</p>

              <p>In the treatment  of this individual's timidity it was necessary, as it is in many other cases,  to teach him that his mother might have been motivated by something other than  love, and that what seems motivated by something other than love, and that what  seems to be love is often not love at all. It has been out of such experience  that I accumulated a body of examples of what seemed to be acts of love and  what seemed not to be love.</p>

            <p>One of the major  distinguishing features between the two seemed to be the conscious or  unconscious purpose in the mind of the lover or nonlover.</p>

          <td width="65%" class="style7"><div align="justify">
              <p>Second, it may be  noticed that, as defined, love is a strangely circular process. For the process of extending one's self is  an evolutionary process. When one has successfully extended one's limits, one  has then grown into a larger state of being. Thus the act of loving is an act  of self-evolution even when the purpose of the act is someone else's growth. It  is through reaching toward evolution that we evolve.</p>

          <td width="59%" class="style7"><div align="justify">
              <p>Third,  this unitary definition of love includes self-love with love for the other. Since I  am human and you are human, to love humans means to love myself as well as you.  (...)<br>
                <br>
              Fourth, the act of  extending one's limits implies effort. One  extends one's limits only by exceeding them, and exceeding limits requires  effort. When we love someone our love becomes demonstrable or real only through  our exertion - through the fact that for that someone (or for ourself) we take  an extra step of walk an extra mile. Love  is not effortless. To the contrary, love is effortful.</p>

          <td width="72%" class="style7"><div align="justify">
              <p>Finally, by use  the word &quot;will&quot; I have attempted to transcend the distinction between desire  and action. Desire is not  necessarily translated into action. Will is desire of sufficient  intensity that it <em>is</em> translated into  action. (...) The desire to love is not itself love. Love is as love does. Love is  an act of will - namely, both an intention and an action. Will also implies choice. We do not have  to love. We choose to love. No matter how much we may think we are loving, if we  are in fact not loving, it is because we have chosen not to love and therefore  do not love despite our good intentions. On  the other hand, whenever we do actually exert ourselves in the cause of  spiritual growth, it is because we have chosen to do so. The choice to love has  been made. </p>
