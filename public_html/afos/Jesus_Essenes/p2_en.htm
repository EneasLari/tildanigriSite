Most notably, I spoke at the Essene Network Summer School in  Dorset for several years. During one of the first lectures a man in the  audience asked a question that made me think. I was talking about Jesus'  travels with his uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, and that he was a rich merchant  trading tin and cloth. The man asked, "Where did Joseph get the tin?" I replied that I didn't know, I hadn't  thought about it. Then the audience said there were many old legends in that  part of England about the tin mines, and that Joseph came there.</p>          </td>

I told the audience I would  certainly like to know more about these legends. As a result in the next few years  I received books and pamphlets from my readers in England. The research done by  the authors seem to be based on solid records and history. I decided that if  this book was ever printed in the U.S. that I would add  an addendum that would include this research. It is utterly amazing how the  entire story continues to hold up under scrutiny, and pieces continue to be  added.</p>            </td>

              <p>&quot;<em>The Drama of the  Lost Disciples</em>&quot;, by George F. Jowett, 1993, Covenant Publishing Co. Ltd., London. This book is  highly recommended as the most complete history I have read. It was probably  the inspiration of the others. While the other books hinted that the entire  story of Joseph in England might be a myth or  legend, this book quotes from ancient historical records dating back to Roman  times and before. His sources cannot be disputed. It is a forgotten story of  the founding of the Christian religion that needs to be retold and brought back  to our time, even though it will probably upset many who are entrenched in  church dogma. It is a privilege and a God-given right to think for oneself and  to constantly search for knowledge. This is the only way to find the answers,  no matter how distasteful they may seem. We must constantly strive to restore  "lost" history, and to preserve it for our posterity. To this aim my work is  devoted.</p>

              <p>Joseph of Arimathea is given only a passing mention in  the Bible. He is referred to as the rich man who claimed the body of Christ,  and gave up his tomb for the burial after the Crucifixion. According to both  Jewish and Roman law, unless the body of an executed criminal was immediately  claimed by the next of kin the body was cast into a common pit with others  where all physical record of them was completely obliterated. Joseph, the  family guardian, personally went to Pilate for permission to claim the body,  remove it from the cross and prepare it for burial in his private sepulcher on  his estate. However, there is much, much more to his story that has been  forgotten and "lost" down through time. The story is glorious and needs to be  brought back to the people of our generation.</p>

            <p align="justify">Joseph of Arimathea was indeed Jesus' uncle, related  to Mary. He was the younger brother of her father. He was one of the wealthiest  men in the world, not just in Jerusalem. He was a metal  magnate controlling the tin and lead industry. Tin was as valuable as gold in  those days, the chief metal used in the production of bronze. It was ultimate  necessity in all countries and in great demand by the warring Romans. Joseph's  world control of tin and lead was due to his vast holdings in the ancient tin  mines of Britain. He had acquired and developed this trade many years before  Jesus began his ministry. The world's major portion of tin was mined in  Cornwall, smelted into ingots and exported throughout the civilized world,  chiefly in Joseph's ships. He owned one of the largest private merchant  shipping fleets afloat that traded in all the ports of the known world.</p>

              <p>There are many legends in England that say when Joseph came to the islands to obtain the tin he often brought his nephew Jesus with him. Less often Mary, the mother of Jesus, accompanied them, especially when Jesus was younger. This would seem only an interesting sidelight, except that we know from the story in this book that Jesus went with Joseph to all the countries of the known world under the disguise of merely traveling on the trading missions. He actually was being taken to study with the various wise teachers, and to study the mysteries of the ancient teachings. This fit very well with the stories of Jesus and Joseph visiting England to transport the valuable tin.</p>

              <p>For many centuries Britain was the only country in the  world where tin was mined and refined, and was called <em>"The Tin Island."</em> In the making of bronze, tin was the main alloy.  Thus it can be safely said that the Bronze Age had its inception in Britain.  The tin trade existed as early as 1500 BC, and was the source of the world's  supply. The Phoenicians were the original inhabitants of Britain and the miners  of lead and tin.</p>

              <p>Many ancient writers say  that the Phoenicians first came to Cornwall for tin over 4000 years before the  birth of Christ. They had the monopoly on the tin trade and jealously guarded  the secret of where the tin mines were located. Later when the Romans tried to  follow their ships to find the location, the Phoenicians would deliberately  wreck their vessel.</p>

              <p>The Phoenicians were a mysterious race. They were tall  men with red hair and blue eyes - not a Mediterranean people. Scholars have had  great difficulty tracing their origin, because Phoenician means "red headed  men", and was not what they called themselves. They were known by various names  in different parts of the world. In early Biblical records they are referred to  as the people of Tarshish. There are some who believe they were the inhabitants  of the lost continent of Atlantis! One thing for certain, whatever name they  went by, they were connected with the tin trade from Britain.</p>

              <p>Another mystery is how, four thousand years before the  birth of Christ, they knew there was tin in Cornwall. How were they able to  sail unknown seas, find a land they did not know existed, and then dig for a  metal which they knew nothing about? Then they found that mixing this new metal  with copper would make bronze? Many scholars believe, and there is much  evidence to support this theory, that before the great flood there lived in  Britain a very advanced civilization, with great practical knowledge of  Science, and which knew more about metallurgy than we do today.<br>

              <p>Glastonbury, where the bulk of the history abounds,  was also the cultural centre of the Druids. Druidism was nationally organized  since 1800 BC.

            <p>Both of these claims have proven false. The Romans  considered anyone who was not Roman to be barbaric. The truth was that there  were large cities, cultural centers, libraries, and forty huge universities  (containing at times as many as 60,000 students) in England that would rival  anything we have today, as far as knowledge and education is concerned. London was founded 270  years before Rome in 1020 BC. </p>

              <p>The Druids had beliefs that were remarkably similar to  the Judaic beliefs, and are believed to have a common root. They had been  looking for a Savior, a Messiah, and they even called him Yesu, the only  recorded mention of the name. This can be explained because the Druids are  believed to have been an offshoot of Jews that settled in the British Isles in ancient times.  They naturally would have some of the same beliefs. They had a mystery school  steeped in the Kaballah (among other subjects, such as: natural philosophy,  astronomy, arithmetic geometry, jurisprudence, medicine, poetry and oratory).</p>

              <p>It normally would take twenty years to complete all of  the studies, but we know that Jesus was not the normal student. He had the  capacity and the ability to absorb information at an incredibly fast rate. This  was evident in the short amount of time he spent studying with the Essenes. By  the time he returned to Jerusalem to begin his  ministry, he had already been taught by all the wise teachers in all the  mystery schools in the world. There are many other stories and legends from  many countries to confirm this. So this was a missing piece of the puzzle, why  he spent so much time in England.</p>

Joseph was too rich and powerful to be killed outright, so a unique method of disposal was devised for him and his accomplices. He and his group were put in an open ship without sails, oars or rudder, and set adrift in the Mediterranean.

Marcella probably went along in her old capacity  of handmaiden to the Bethany sisters, and not  one of the missionary band. Joseph of Arimathea was Mary's guardian until her  death. As she was under his protection he would not have left her in Jerusalem where she would  have been in extreme danger.

              <p>Their descendants even established the first church in  Rome hundreds of years before the Vatican even existed.  Another remarkable fact: all of the royal line of British kings and queens,  down to the present Queen Elizabeth II, have descended directly from Joseph of  Arimathea. Thus they are all related through a long unbroken line of ancestry  to Jesus.</p>

              <p>There is much, much more to this story, but it is too  long for this addendum. At that period in history Britain was the only free  country in the world. The Romans never conquered England. In 120 AD Britain was incorporated  (by treaty - not conquest). There were many bloody wars as Rome tried  unsuccessfully to take over the birthplace of Christianity, and many false  tales spread when Rome finally was  converted three hundred years later. They tried to topple Britain as being the first  country to accept the teachings of Christ. Many years later in the 1400s there  was a big debate with the Vatican over which was the  oldest church or the first church. Was it England, France or Spain? They were all  founded during the same time period within three years after the crucifixion of  Christ. It was finally agreed, and became part of the Vatican record, that the  church at Glastonbury was the first church.</p>

The story of Joseph's accomplishments was  held in such great importance that immediately after the invention of printing,  when books were so scare, his story was printed. (1516 and 1520).</p>

              <p>Joseph should be remembered and honoured for following Jesus' example when he build the first Christian church in the world. It was hundreds of years before the rest of the world caught up, while Joseph and his band of 12 disciples were establishing the beginnings of Christianity. Today few people know this remarkable story, and accept the Roman Catholic version of the origins of Christianity. For the entire narrative, based on solid historical documents, I suggest reading &quot;The Drama of the Lost Disciples&quot;. It will open many eyes to the "rest of the story."</p>
