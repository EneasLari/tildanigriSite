It seems to know these things out of thin air, so to say. So, in the  heart of things man can know things out of thin air, the way the plants do with  the more basic things.

And so the piece of debris will gradually travel down  the shore being picked up and placed back down by the waves. He said that this  is like your cycle of lives.
