              <p>My work is not connected in any way with university institutes.  Consequently we have no polyclinical material at our disposal. Also, you cannot  possibly learn analytical psychology by studying its object, since it consists  exclusively of what you don't know about yourself. You can see in another  person only what you yourself know. But what you yourself already know you  don't need to learn. Also it is quite impossible for two of you to conduct a  real analysis of a third person. In that way you would never get at the other  person at all.</p>

              <p>You yourself must be able to fulfil everything you expect of your  patient. If you expect him to hand out his intimate experiences, you must first  of all be in a position to do it at least three times better. No analysis of  another person will ever provide this unique experience which the analysis of  your own material can give you. Only in this way do you learn to recognize the  living psychic process which is not identical with consciousness. No one who  has not experienced analysis in his own person has a right to practice it. This  is my firm conviction and I shan't budge from it under any circumstances. If  you agree with this, then we can consider further possibilities.</p>
