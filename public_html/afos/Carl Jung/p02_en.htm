            <p>The difference between most people and myself is that for me the &quot;dividing  walls&quot; are transparent. That is my peculiarity. Others find these walls so  opaque that they see nothing behind them and therefore think nothing is there.  To some extent I perceive the processes going on in the background, and that  gives me an inner certainty. People who see nothing have no certainties and can  draw no conclusions - or do not trust them even if they do. I do not know what  started me off perceiving the stream of life. Probably the unconscious itself.  Or perhaps my early dreams. They determined my course from the beginning. </p>

              <p>Knowledge of processes in the background early shaped my relationship to  the world. Basically, that relationship was the same in my childhood as it is  to this day. As a child I felt myself to be alone, and I am still, because I  know things and must hint at things which others apparently know nothing of,  and for the most part do not want to know. Loneliness does not come from having  no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important  to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.</p>

            <p>The loneliness began with the experiences of my early dreams, and  reached its climax at the time I was working on the unconscious. If a man knows  more than others, he becomes lonely. But loneliness is not necessarily inimical  to companionship, for no one is more sensitive to companionship than the lonely  man, and companionship thrives only when each individual remembers his  individuality and does not identify himself with others.</p>

              <p>It is important to have a secret, a premonition of things unknown. It  fills life with something impersonal, a <em>numinosum</em>. A man who has never experienced that has missed  something important. He must sense that he lives in a world which in some  respects is mysterious; that things happen and can be experienced which remain  inexplicable; that not everything which happens can be anticipated. The  unexpected and the incredible belong in this world. Only then is life whole.  For me the world has from the beginning been infinite and ungraspable.</p>
