This gave me an inner security, and, though I could never prove it to myself, it proved itself to me. I did not have this certainty, it had me. Nobody could rob me of the conviction that it was enjoined upon me to do what God wanted and not what I wanted. That gave me the strength to go my own way. Often I had the feeling that in all decisive matters I was no longer among men, but was alone with God.</p>

He who always is was there. These talks with  the &quot;Other&quot; were my profoundest experiences: on the one hand a bloody struggle,  on the other supreme ecstasy.</p>
