              <p>You  can learn a great deal of psychology through studying books, but you will find  that this psychology is not very helpful in practical life. <a href="#" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">A man entrusted with the care of souls </a> ought  to have a certain wisdom of life of which does not consist of words only but  chiefly of experience. Such psychology, as I understand it, is not only a piece  of knowledge but a certain wisdom of life at the same time.</p>

              <p>If such a thing can be taught at all, it must be in the way of a  personal experience of the human soul. Such an experience is possible only when  the teaching has a personal character, namely when you are personally taught  and not generally. In India since ancient times they have the custom that practically everybody of  a certain education, at least, has a guru, a spiritual leader who teaches you  and you alone what you ought to know. Not everybody needs to know the same  thing and this kind of knowledge can never be taught in the same way.</p>

              <p>Anybody whose calling it is to guide souls should have his own soul  guided first, so that he knows what it means to deal with the human soul.  Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of  other people. It would not help you very much to study books only, though it is  indispensable too. But it would help you most to have a personal insight into  the secrets of the human soul.</p>

You may try to find out what I mean in  my books and if you have a close friend, try to look behind his screen in order  to discover yourself. That would be a good beginning. </p>
