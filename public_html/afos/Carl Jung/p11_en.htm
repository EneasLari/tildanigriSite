              <p>In  my opinion it is scarcely possible to correlate the various forms of neurosis  with aetiological archetypes. Things are not as simple and schematic as that.  So far as the aetiology of the neuroses is concerned I can only say that a  neurosis ensues whenever the inner psychic situation is not in accord with the  outer, and one or the other is consequently disregarded to an unwarranted  extent in the effort to adapt.

              <p>I am, to be sure, a doctor, but even more than that I am concerned with  the saving good of man, for I am also a psychiatrist. I would have said to  Kierkegaard straight off: &quot;It doesn't matter what <strong><em>you</em></strong> say, but what <strong><em>it</em> </strong>says in you. To <strong><em>it</em> </strong>you must address your answers. God is straightway with you  and is the voice within you. You have to have it out with that voice.&quot; Whatever stuffing Kierkegaard had in him would then  have been plain to see. A changed man, certainly but a <strong><em>whole</em></strong> one, not a jangling  hither and thither of displeasing fragmentary souls.</p>

              <p>True creative genius does not let itself be spoilt by analysis, but is  freed from the impediments and distortions of a neurosis. Neurosis does not  produce art. It is uncreative and inimical to life. It is failure and bungling.  But the moderns mistake morbidity for creative birth - part of the general  lunacy of our time.</p>

              <p>Neurosis is a justified doubt in oneself and continually poses the  ultimate question of trust in man and in God. Doubt is creative if it is  answered by deeds, and so is neurosis if it exonerates itself as having been a  phase - a crisis which is pathological only when chronic. Neurosis is a  protracted crisis degenerated into a habit, the daily catastrophe ready to use. </p>

              <p>To the question whether anxiety is the subject or object of the  philosophers, I can only answer: anxiety can never be the object unless it is,  or was, first the subject. In other words, anxiety, as affect, always <strong><em>has  us</em></strong>, wherefore we say - euphemistically! - &quot;<em>I have anxiety.&quot;</em></p>

              <p>The philosopher starts from the anxiety that possesses him and then,  through reflection, turns his subjective state of being possessed into a  perception of anxiety. Question: is it an object worthy of anxiety, or a  poltroonery of the ego, shitting its pants? What is the &quot;anxiety of the ego&quot;, this &quot;modestly modest&quot; overweeningness  and presumption of a little tin god, compared with the almighty shadow of the  Lord, which is the fear that fills heaven and earth? The first leads to  apotropaic defensive philosophy, the second to <em>&quot;</em><em>gnosis theou&quot; </em> (knowledge of God).</p>
