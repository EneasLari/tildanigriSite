But when more and more  earth-minded people come into power in times to come, we will close the  initiation pyramid with blocks of stone from the inside and will dematerialize  everything in the initiation chamber. The secret of divine creative energy will  not fall into uninitiated hands. Thousands of years later when people break  into the pyramids, they will find nothing -  absolutely nothing - not even human skeletons.

            <p>There are  many souls on earth today who fulfil the prerequisites for the great  initiation. It is our duty to initiate all of these candidates if, despite our  warning, <em>they</em> <em>repeat three times</em> their wish to be initiated.<br>
              <br>
              In initiation  the candidate becomes conscious on every plane of creation. All unconscious  portions of his soul become conscious; he has no "subconscious" and no  "superconscious". During his initiation, the consciousness of the initiate  becomes whole, total <em>all-consiousness</em>.  The circle which began with his becoming conscious in matter - in the body -  the moment he fell from unity, is closed.</p>

            <p><br>
              The candidate  consciously unites with his own complementary half which previously was always  present as an unconscious portion of his soul, like a negative image, a strange  being, and which because of its power of attraction manifested itself as  longings, powerful urges and unrest in his body. The consciousness returns to  unity, and there is no longer a complementary half, for the complementary half <em>has also been made conscious.</em> This  reunion we call "mystic marriage".<br>
              <br>
              "Marriage"  always means a union of positive and negative. On earth, however, "marriage"  means the vain attempt to achieve union with another being in the body. But the  mystic union of the spirit takes place <em>in  the consciousness </em>and brings complete, never-ending fulfilment; for the  union with one's own complementary half means union with <em>God.</em> The cirlce is closed again!"
