Or that he could - even though for only a short time - remove his whole  body from the earth ... by jumping? Lift your arm  and observe how you do it. Isn't it true that you contract your muscles and  they lift your arm?  Every moment of your body is brought about with a contraction of your muscles.  But what contracts your muscles?

              "Father, I  have often observed what happens when <em>I want</em> something. But I have only been able to notice that when <em>I want</em> something, I can send out a force and give this force  direction. For example, as you just said, if I want to raise my arm from its  relaxed hanging position - it hangs because the earth is attracting it - then  this force which flows out of me through my will flows into my arm and forces  my muscles to contract and through this to raise my arm".<br>

            <p>"Very true",  says Ptahhotep, "By virtue of the fact that your will power has flowed into your  arm and muscles, <em>you have conquered the  enormous gravitational power of the earth </em>on your arm. This is true when  you jump too, but only for a short time, because your will power is only  greater than the earth's gravitational pull for a short time. So you see time  consumes your will power transformed into physical power. Time does that! And  space? You've used your power to raise your arm, or your body <em>in altitude, to</em> <em>remove</em> it from the earth, hence to move it further <em>in space</em>. Thus  you see that your power is consumed by two great factors: <em>time</em> and <em>space</em>. </p>

              If you could  amplify your will power and store it within your body, you could conquer the  earth's gravitational pull for a longer time and remain at a greater distance  from the earth. You could glide through the air! You can't do that now because  you haven't yet developed consciousness on this divine plane. The initiated, on  the other hand, who are conscious on the divine plane, can draw directly on  this infinite eternal source of power, without transforming it, and when they  wish, float through the air just as long as they direct their will power  against the gravitational pull of the earth.</p>

              The initiated  person knows all vibrations and possesses consciously developed organs with  which to use these powers. You know, for example, the power of thought with  which we communicate telepathically. These powers too we control through a  corresponding higher organ of our brain. Human beings don't even know they have  such organs. The initiated is able to radiate the very highest of all powers,  the divine, creative power. This is the power and radiation of <em>life</em>, of eternal <em>being</em>. The entire universe is alive and continues to exist by  virtue of this power. To make conscious use of it lies only within the  capabilities of the <em>God-man</em>, the only  creature that is, in his consciousness, identical with <em>God</em> and radiates this power from his God-consciousness, his cosmic  all-consciousness. No other creature could endure this power consciously" (...)</p>
