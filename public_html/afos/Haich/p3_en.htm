Then, <a href="#" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">towards the end of this era</a>, when the  vernal point approaches the next constellation - that of the <em>Water</em> <em>Bearer</em> - people make technical discoveries and inventions based on  wave energies. This is one of the early effects of the budding <em>Water Bearer</em> era, an age of technical  achievement. The radiation of the <em>Water  Bearer</em> constellation, which knows no limitations and sweeps all obstacles  out of its path, reveals itself in the ideas and social concepts of humanity.  At the end of the era of the <em>Fishes</em>,  these new energies cause great revolutions in the places where people react  most powerfully to them. <br>
              <br>
              I see  thousands of people of the ruling class sitting in prison, while a spirit with  the characteristics of the new coming era decapitates or otherwise kills countless  people of the upper class.</p>

              A vision for  the time when the energies of the <em>Water  Bearer</em> are working with full power shows me that the great teacher of this  epoch abolishes all the boundaries between the three dominant religions. With  his own person he proves that the inner core of all religions is one and the  same truth, one and the same <em>God</em>. The  boundary between religion and science disappears too, as people discover that  everything, even matter, is a wave movement. They learn that the only  differences between manifestations of the spirit and those of matter are  differences of frequency, while in its essence <em>everything</em>  is only the  manifestation of the one, single, prime source of all forces, <em>God. Everything</em> <span class="style10">is</span> <em>a wave</em>, just as the symbolic representation of the <em>Water Bearer</em> constellation shows: a  supernal being pouring waves out of his pitcher. <br>

              The spiritual  movements on the earth show this effect. Science discovers the "wave" theory,  and I see countless inventions based on waves. I see pictures of people,  landscapes and objects - pictures made by the effect of light waves. I see  different kinds of devices which send out waves. Waves penetrate matter and  reveal its solidity. There are waves that show what elements are present in the  matter of the planets and fixed stars, electric waves, waves of sound, light  and smell. Medical science&nbsp; has stopped  giving treatments with water in fabour of treatments based on <em>waves</em>. All kinds of waves, from  infra-red to ultra-violet, short waves and still shorter waves, even more  penetrating waves and frequencies ... all in use by science!</p>

            The  constellation of the <em>Water Bearer</em> belongs to the airy face of <em>God</em>. And  mankind conquers the air with <em>air</em>,  with energies won form matter in the airy state. I see people moved onward from  the steam engine to other machines operated by gas. And then my astonished eyes  follow huge locusts high up in the air, made by human hands and carrying people  in their bellies! These machines are powered by gas: <em>Air</em> conquers <em>air</em> ...<br>
            <br>
          Through the  complementary sign of the <em>Lion</em> people  again recognize the strongest manifestation of God on earth. The sun, the great <em>Ra</em>, is again acknowledged as the  prime source of all manifestation of earthly energy. </p></td>

              Once more  people have become sun worshippers, even though not in a religious sense. The  influence of the <em>Lion</em> shows itself in  another plane too. The effect of the <em>Water  Bearer</em> is to abolish all boundaries, all limitations. But the absence of  boundaries without a concentrating mid-point means mental disease, spiritual  death. The boundlessness of the <em>Water  Bearer</em> would affect the unconscious masses as a mental illness running  throughout all humanity, causing anarchy and chaos, and destroying everything.  Through the complementary sign of the <em>Lion</em>,  however, dominion is concentrated in individual persons - dictators - who group  the people about themselves and guide them. <br>
              <br>
              In this epoch  people discover traffic and intercourse with other planets. Boundaries and  obstacles disappear, and with them the isolated state of the earth in cosmic  space. And as the boundaries between countries disappear too, all humanity is  governed from one centre. "One stable, one shepherd". &nbsp;(...)</p>
