                  <td width="65%" valign="top" class="style25"><p align="justify">One Sunday,  Edgar came home from church, particularly stirred by the day's message. He  slipped off into the woods and spent the afternoon reading his Bible and  praying for the chance to heal the sick. His mind was still full of the fervor  when he went to bed that night.<br>
                    <br>
                  </p>
                    <div align="justify">Some time after midnight, he  became aware that the room was suffused with a strange radiance brighter than  the light of the full moon. He sat up sharply and
                      <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">saw a figure standing at the foot of his bed</a>. It was a woman, and he  thought first it was his mother. He started to speak, and the figure seemed to  melt away.
                      <br>
                          <br>
                          <br>
                      </div>
                    <p align="justify">Edgar jumped  out of bed and ran to his mother's room. His first thought was that someone was  ill, and she needed him. Both his mother and father were sound asleep, and the  babies were quiet. He went back to his bed, trembling, not knowing what he had  seen, but frightened by it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  </p>
                    <div align="justify">As he lay down, the radiance returned, growing  brighter, until it paled the moonlight. Suddenly the figure was back again. It  was a woman, and on her back were curving shadow shapes, like the angels' wings  in the Bible pictures. He tried to speak but his mouth was dry, his breath  locked with fright.
                      <br>
                          <br>
                          <br>
                      </div>
                    <p align="justify">The woman smiled. "Don't  be afraid," she said. "Thy prayers are heard. <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv5','visible')">You will have your wish if you will remain faithful</a>. Be true to yourself.  Help the sick, the afflicted."<br>

                  </p>
                    <p align="justify">The light  faded, and she was gone. Edgar ran outside into the moonlit yard and fell on  his knees to give thanks for the vision and the promise.</p>

Don't ever abuse the gifts or treat them lightly. Hunt  for that purpose inside yourself in prayer. When you find it, be true to it.

Many leading  doctors were embracing it with enthusiasm. Newspapers and magazines carried  long articles on the subject, and the new term, "suggestive therapeutics," was  becoming a household word. Schools sprang up across the country to teach the  new science, and psychologists showed awakening interest in the field.</p>

                    <p align="justify"><br>
                      Edgar drew a  couple of deep, shuddering breaths, and then his whole body relaxed. In a shaky  voice, Layne droned, "Your unconscious mind is looking into your body. It is  looking at your throat. It will tell us what it sees that is wrong with that  throat and what can be done to cure the trouble."</p>
                    <p align="justify"><br>

I'm fitting out a couple of rooms over the hat shop with your name on the  door as a psychic diagnostician. We'll charge a reasonable fee for a reading,  as I call it.

I don't know whether or not I'll ever get it back, but if I do, I know  I'll never abuse it again. I used to ask for signs to guide me, and when I got  no anwer, I began to doubt.

He was haunted by the  slowness with which he could be nibble into that mountain of need. The number  of readings he could give without exhaustion was limited. The Squire had become  adept at halting each session before Edgar's strength was drained. No amount of  argument would sway him on that point.</p>

                      Every mail  brought new requests, and almost every day, people came to the office for  personal readings. Over the protests of Gertrude and his father, Edgar began  giving occasional extra evening readings in a vain effort to catch up. They  tried, with no greater success, to keep him from reading the incoming mail.  Appointments were piled up weeks ahead.</p>                    </td>

                  <td width="65%" valign="top" class="style25"><p align="justify">In May 1927, Edgar's  dreams took a forward leap with the incorporation of the Association of  National Investigators. Anyone who mistook this for an organization of private  eyes was disabused by the motto: <em>That We  May Make Manifest the Love of God and Man</em><em>.</em></p>
                    <p align="justify"><br>
                      This association was  largely Morton Blumenthal's brain child: "... to engage in general psychic  research and to provide for the practical application of any knowledge obtained  through the media of phychic phenomena." He envisioned a farflung network of  students interested in the readings and in other psychic manifestations, all  studying and contributing knowledge that could be put to practical use in  everyday life.</p>

                    <div align="justify">Most important to Edgar,  the vision included his hospital. Combined with it would be a group headquarters  with a library on the occult, a vault to preserve copies of the readings, and a  staff to study and correlate the data. It was unthinkable that all the vast  knowledge coming through Cayce was meant to be used by one person and then  forgotten. The right study of his thousands of readings would surely reveal  knowledge of value to everyone.                    </div>

                    "How long  should I stay?" was the next question, and the answer was blunt.� <br>

                    Edgar and  Gertrude went to Roanoke,  and for a little time, Edgar seemed to be gaining. But he could not keep  himself from worrying about those who needed his help and were forced to wait.  Eventually, he fretted himself into a stroke that left one side of his body  paralyzed.<br>
                    <br>
                    At Virginia    Beach, Mae awoke one morning with the  strong feeling that she should visit Edgar. When she got there, she saw the  dark misery in his eyes. He was homesick for his house, his friends, his  beautiful lake. She got on the telephone. The word spread, and friends  materialized with an ambulance, oxygen flasks, all the things he needed.<br>
                    <br>
                    He arrived  home just after Thanksgiving and was happier but no stronger, lying where he  could look out over the lake and see the bass jumping at sunrise and sunset. On  New Year's Day 1945, Mae dropped in for her daily visit. Edgar managed his  twisted, half-paralyzed smile and whispered, <em>"It is all arranged ... I am to be healed on Friday, the fifth of  January."</em><br>
                    <br>
                    On the  evening of January 3, Mae stood by his bedside and saw him draw his last  labored breath. Suddenly, she understood what he had meant. This miracle of  healing would take place on Friday, as he had told her - but on the other side  of the veil that he had gone so much to lift.</p>
                    <div align="justify">She raised her eyes then, looking out toward the  sunset, and saw the final miracle. In Virginia Beach and in Norfolk and up and down the coast, they still speak wonderingly of the  phenomenon that accompanied that evening's radiant sunset. Suddenly, a shaft of  bright red shot up like an obelisk from the disc of the setting sun. It reached  almost to the zenith and lingered there, a monument in the sky, until long  after sunset                    </div>
