              <p>A certain person  therefore relates, that Eurytus said, that a shepherd feeding his sheep near  the tomb of Philolaus, heard someone singing. But the person to whom this was  related, did not at all disbelieve the narration, but asked what kind of  harmony it was? Both of them, however, were Pythagoreans, and Eurytus was the  disciple of Philolaus. It is likewise said, that a certain person told  Pythagoras, that he appeared to himself once to converse with his father who  was dead, and that he asked Pythagoras what this indicated? Pythagoras replied,  that it indicated nothing; but that he had in reality conversed with his  father. As therefore, said he, nothing is signified by my now discoursing with  you, so neither is anything signified by your conversing with your father.</p>

For they did not conceive that some things are possible  to the Gods, but others impossible, as those fancy who reason sophistically;  but they believed that all things are possible to the Gods. And this very  assertion is the beginning of the verses, which they ascribe to Linus and which  are as follow:</p>
