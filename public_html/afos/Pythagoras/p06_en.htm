              <p>For he said that  the entrance of men into the present life, resembled the progression of a crowd  to some public spectacle. For these men of every description assemble with  different views: one hastening to sell his wares for the sake of money and  gain; but another that he may acquire renown by exhibiting the strength of his  body; and there is also a third class of men, and those the most liberal, who  assemble for the sake of surveying the places, the beautiful works of art, the  specimens of valor, and the literary productions which are usually exhibited on  such occasions. Thus also in the present life, men of all-various pursuits are  collected together in one and the same place. For some are influenced by the  desire of riches and luxury; others by the love of power and dominion; and others  are possessed with an insane ambition for glory. But the most pure and  unadulterated character, is that of the man who gives himself to the  contemplation of the most beautiful things, and whom it is proper to call a  philosopher.</p>

              <p>He adds, that the  survey of all heaven, and of the stars that revolve in it, is indeed beautiful,  when the order of them is considered. For they derive this beauty and order by  the participation of the first and the intelligible essence. But that first  essence is the nature of number and reasons [i.e. productive principles] which  pervades through all things, and according to which all these [celestial  bodies] are elegantly arranged, and fitly adorned. And wisdom indeed, truly so  called certain science which is conversant with the first beautiful objects,  and these divine, undecaying, and possessing an invariable sameness  subsistence; by the participation of which other things also may be called  beautiful; philosophy is the appetition of a thing of this kind.</p>
