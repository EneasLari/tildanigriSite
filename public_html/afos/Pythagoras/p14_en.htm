              <p>Of his wisdom,  however, the commentaries written by the Pythagoreans afford, in short, the  greatest indication; for they adhere to truth in every thing, and are more  concise than all other compositions, so that they savour of the ancient  elegance of style, and the conclusions are exquisitely deduced with divine  science. They are also replete with the most condensed conceptions, and are in  other respects various and diversified both in the form and the matter. At one  and the same time likewise, they are transcendently excellent, and without any  deficiency in the diction, and are in an eminent degree full of clear and  indubitable arguments,</p>

And in short there is nothing pertaining to human knowledge which is  not accurately discussed in these writings. If therefore it is acknowledged,  that of the [Pythagoric] writings which are now in circulation, some were  written by Pythagoras himself, but others consist of what he was heard to say,  and on this account are anonymous, but are referred to Pythagoras as their  author; -if this be the case, it is evident that he was abundantly skilled in  all wisdom. </p>

              <p>But it is said that  he very much applied himself to geometry among the Egyptians. For with the  Egyptians there are many geometrical problems; since it is necessary that from  remote periods, and from the time of the Gods themselves, on account of the  increments and decrements of the Nile, those that were  skilful should have measured all the Egyptian land which they cultivated. Hence  also geometry derived its name. Neither did they negligently investigate the  theory of the celestial orbs, in which likewise Pythagoras was skilled.  Moreover, all the theorems about lines appear to have been derived from thence.  For it is said that what pertains to computation and numbers, was discovered in  Phoenicia. </p>
