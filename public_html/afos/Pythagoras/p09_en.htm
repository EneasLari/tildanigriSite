              <p>In the first place,  therefore, Pythagoras in making trial [of the aptitude of those that came to  him] considered whether they could <em>echemuthein</em>,  i.e. whether they were able to refrain from speaking (for this was the word  which he used), and surveyed whether they could conceal in silence and preserve  what they had learnt and heard. In the next place, he observed whether they  were modest. For he was much more anxious that they should be silent than that they  should speak. He likewise directed his attention to every other particular;  such as whether they were astonished by the energies of any immoderate passion  or desire. Nor did he in a superficial manner consider how they were affected  with respect to anger or desire, or whether they were contentious or ambitious,  or how they were disposed with reference to friendship or strife. And if on his  surveying all these particulars accurately, they appeared to him to be endued  with worthy manners, then he directed his attention to their facility in  learning and their memory. </p>

              <p>For he surveyed how  they were naturally disposed with respect to gentleness. But he called this <em>catartysis</em>, i.e. <em>elegance of manners</em>. And he considered ferocity as hostile to such  a mode of education. For impudence, shamelessness, intemperance, slothfulness,  slowness in learning, unrestrained licentiousness, disgrace, and the like, are  the attendants on savage manners; but the contraries on gentleness and  mildness. He considered these things, therefore, in making trial of those that  came to him, and in these he exercised the learners. And those that were  adapted to receive the goods of the wisdom he possessed, he admitted to be his  disciples, and thus endeavoured to elevate them to scientific knowledge. But if  he perceived that any one of them was unadapted, he expelled him as one of  another tribe, and a stranger.</p>
