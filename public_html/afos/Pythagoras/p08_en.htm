              <p>Of the appellation  of all these, which are summarily comprehended in one and the same name, that  of friendship, Pythagoras is acknowledged to have been the inventor and  legislator. And, in short, he was the cause to his disciples of the most  appropriate converse with the Gods, both when they were awake and when asleep;  a thing which never takes place in a soul disturbed by anger, or pain, or  pleasure, or, by Jupiter, by any other base desire, or defiled by ignorance,  which is more unholy and noxious than all these. By all these inventions,  therefore, he divinely healed and purified the soul, resuscitated and saved its  divine part, and conducted to the intelligible its divine eye, which, as Plato  says, is better worth saving than ten thousand <em>corporeal eyes;</em> for by looking through this alone, when it is  strengthened and clarified by appropriate aids, the truth pertaining to all  beings is perceived. Referring therefore to this, Pythagoras purified the  dianoetic power of the soul. Such also was the form with him of erudition, and  these were the things to which he directed his view.</p>
