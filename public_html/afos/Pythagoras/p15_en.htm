              <p>And he was the  first indeed that denominated philosophy, and said that it was the desire, and  as it were love of wisdom. But he defined wisdom to be the science of the truth  which is in beings. And he said that beings are immaterial and eternal natures,  and alone possess an efficacious power, such as incoproreal essences. But that  the rest of things are only homonymously beings, and are so denominated through  the participation of real beings, and such are corporeal and material forms,  which are generated and corrupted, and never truly are. And that wisdom is the  science of things which are properly beings, but not of such as are  homonymously so. </p>

              <p>For corporeal  natures are neither the objects of science nor admit of a stable knowledge,  since they are infinite and incomprehensible by science, and are as it were  non-beings, when compared with universals, and are incapable of being properly  circumscribed by definition. For it happens that the perception of things which  are homonymously beings, and which are never truly what they seem to be,  follows the apprehension of real beings; just as the knowledge of particulars  follows the science of universals. For he who knows universals properly, says  Archytas, will also have a clear perception of the nature of particulars. </p>
