              <p>The report, also,  is very much disseminated, that he showed his golden thigh to the Hyperborean  Abaris, who said that he resembled the Apollo among the Hyperboreans, and of  whom Abaris was the priest; and that he did this in order that Abaris might  apprehend this to be true, and that he was not deceived in his opinion. Ten  thousand other more divine and more admirable particulars likewise are  uniformly and unanimously related of <em>the  man:</em> such as infallible predictions of earthquakes, rapid expulsions of  pestilence and violent winds, instantaneous cessations of the effusion of hail,  and a tranquilisation of the waves of rivers and seas, in order that his  disciples might easily pass over them.</p>

Their deeds, however, are manifest. To which we may  add,<strong> </strong>that Empedocles was surnamed <em>an expeller of winds;</em> Epimenides, <em>an expiator;</em> and Abaris, <em>a walker on air;</em> because being carried  on the dart which was given to him by the Hyporborean Apollo, he passed over  rivers and seas and inaccessible places, like one walking on the air. Certain  persons likewise are of opinion, that Pythagoras did the same thing, when in  the same day he discoursed with his disciples at Metapontum and Tauromenium.</p>
            <p align="justify">It is also said,  that he predicted there would be an earthquake from the water of a well which  he had tasted; and that a ship which was sailing with a prosperous wind, would  be merged in the sea. And let these, indeed, be the indications of his piety.</p></td>
