              <p>Pythagoras was likewise  of opinion that <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">music contributed greatly to health</a>, if it was used in an  appropriate manner. For he was accustomed to employ a purification of this  kind, but not in a careless way. And he called the medicine which is obtained  through music by the name of purification. But he employed such a melody as  this about the vernal season. For he placed in the middle a certain person who  played on the lyre, and seated in a circle round him those who were able to  sing. And thus, when the person in the centre struck the lyre, those that  surrounded him sung certain paeans, through which they were seen to be  delighted, and to become elegant and orderly in their manners.</p>

              <p>But at another time  they used music in the place of medicine. And there are certain melodies  devised as remedies against the passions of the soul, and also against despondency  and lamentation, which Pythagoras invented as things that afford the greatest  assistance in these maladies. And again, he employed other melodies against  rage and anger, and against every aberration of the soul. There is also another  kind of modulation invented as a remedy against desires. He likewise used  dancing; but employed the lyre as an instrument for this purpose. For he conceived that the  pipe was calculated to excite insolence, was a theatrical instrument, and had  by no means a liberal sound. Select verses also by Homer and Hesiod were used  by him, for the purpose of correcting the soul.</p>
