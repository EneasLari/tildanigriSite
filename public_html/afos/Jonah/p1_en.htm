            There is a change that occurs in consciousness, meaning a change in mass  consciousness, every two thousand years. There is also a change of  consciousness in that which would be called earth's consciousness. For the  earth is a living, breathing entity. It also experiences a change every twenty four  thousand years. Now both are coinciding. It is, the age of Aquarius coming  forth (for humanity), but also the age of &quot;Cualidu&quot; - would be the word used  closest to the vibration - (for the earth) blending as one. <br>

Just as a human has a particular sign they are born under - there is  also a sign for the earth, through the signs of the universe. The name  &quot;Cualidu&quot; is the sigh of this universal age, which the earth works with.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>The  prophecy of the blue light comes through the blue light that is directed unto  the earth plane. <br>
Blue,  also, in its internal meaning is symbolic of <strong><em>service</em></strong>. It is an age of &quot;how  can I serve more&quot;. Therefore, within the blue light is the prophecy of service  unto others.<br>
The  earth will not be destroyed. It is to understand that the earth is part of a  galactic system. Even though the majority of humanity has shut off from their  consciousness their connection with the galactic communities, the earth is  still connected with the galactic communities.<br>

The  earth is choosing to raise its vibration unto a fourth dimensional vibration.<br>
            Thereby, the earth will not permit itself to be destroyed. If  assistance were not offered <em>(meaning  by the non-incarnated souls of guides, masters, etc.)</em>, the intellect  of humanity in its present state would in fact attempt to destroy the planet  through the <strong><em>energy of greed.</em></strong> This &quot;pollution&quot; began during  the &quot;industrial age&quot;. The planet has the ability  to cleanse itself and it shall cleanse itself, with or without the agreement of  humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
