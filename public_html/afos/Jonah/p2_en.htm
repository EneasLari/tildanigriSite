            <br>
            The &quot;inheritance  of the earth&quot; is coming to see the earth as the mother that gives birth. For it  is through the mother earth and the father sky that birth is given to humanity.  Through this birth, through this process of living, begins the understanding of  the evolution of god within the self. (...)<br>

            <p>As each one  of you searches within your own heart, each will guided to work with creating  this... It is important because of the tendency of the human consciousness to  enter into fear, that these so-called &quot;centres&quot;, these so-called &quot;communities&quot;,  will not be owned by a single individual, but that a collective energy is  brought together in service to one another. That there will not be such as a  leader telling ones how to live, but each one may come into an agreement about  the sharing of the heart, which is the expression of what ones are feeling  without judgment. This is coming into the togetherness of what truly the Age of  Aquarius is representative of. <br>

It is only within our  purpose to offer assistance. We are here to teach the students how to become as  teachers. It is our purpose to assist in the opening of the heart, not in the  creating of the intellect but in the opening of the heart so that truly the  bond of love shall flow as it did in the land of Mu. That  circle again is returning. It is a healing circle, just as the earth is in a circle  of healing; humanity is in a circle of healing.</p>
