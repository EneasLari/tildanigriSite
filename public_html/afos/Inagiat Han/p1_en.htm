          <td width="73%"><p align="justify">The Sufi  understands that although God is the source of all knowledge, inspiration, and  guidance, yet man is the medium through which God chooses to impart His  knowledge to the world. He imparts it through one who is a man in the eyes of  the world, but God in his consciousness. It is the mature soul that draws  blessings from the heavens, and God speaks through that soul. Although the  tongue of God is busy speaking through all things, yet in order to speak to the  deaf ears of many among us, it is necessary for Him to speak through the lips  of man. He has done this all through the history of man, every great teacher of  the past having been this Guiding Spirit living the life of God in human guise.  </p>          </td>

            In other words, their human guise consists of various coats worn by the same  person, who appeared to be different in each. Shiva, Buddha, Rama, Krishna on  the one side, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad on the other; and many more,  known or unknown to history, always one and the same person.</div></td>

              Those  who saw the person and knew Him recognized Him in whatever form or guise; those  who could only see the coat went astray. To the Sufi therefore there is only  one Teacher, however differently He may be named at different periods of  history, and He comes constantly to awaken humanity from the slumber of this  life of illusion, and to guide man onwards towards divine perfection. <br>
              <br>
              As the  Sufi progresses in this view he recognizes his Master, <br>
              not only in the holy  ones, but in the wise, in the foolish, 
              in the saint and in the sinner, and has  never allowed <br>
