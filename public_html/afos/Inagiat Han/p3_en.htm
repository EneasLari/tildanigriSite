So the  soul must be of a certain development before it will handle wisdom with wisdom.  The developed soul shows his fragrance in his atmosphere, colour, the  expression of his countenance, and sweetness of his personality, as a flower  spreads its fragrance around, and as a fruit when ripe changes its colour and  becomes sweet.</p>

              One may ask  why the awakened ones do not awaken people in the world from the sleep of  confusion. The answer is, that it is not to be advised that little children,  whose only happiness is slumber, should be awakened. Their growth depends on  their sleep. If they are kept up late they become ill, and will not be so  useful in the affairs of life when they are grown up. Childhood needs more  sleep, and the children must sleep.</p>

              Such is the nature of immature souls. They  are children, however old their bodies may appear. Their fancies, their joys,  their delights are for unimportant things in life, as the life of children is  absorbed in sweets and toys. Therefore those who are awakened walk slowly and  gently, lest their footsteps may disturb the slumber of the sleeping ones. They  only awaken on their way those whom they find tossing in their beds. They are  the ones to whom the travellers on the spiritual path give their hand quietly.  It is for this reason that the spiritual path is called the mystical way. It is  not unkind to awaken a few and to let many sleep, but on the other hand it is  great kindness to let those slumber who require sleep.</p>
