          <td width="67%"><p align="justify">For those  on the spiritual path, thinkers, students and meditative souls, it is of the  greatest importance to know the condition of their spirit from time to time by  consulting their voice. That is their barometer. From morning till evening one  can see the weather - the weather created by oneself; whether it is warm or  cold, or whether it is spring or winter. One's voice is that barometer that  shows to us what is coming, because what will come is the reaction, the result  of what is created, and the voice is indicative of it.<br>
              <br>
              Those who  think still more deeply on this subject will be able to see how, step by step,  they are progressing in the spiritual path, if only they consult their voice.  Every step in the spiritual path brings about a little change. By a distinct  study of the voice you will find that it is so. When you go back, you will find  by the change: &quot;I had gone so much further, and I have gone back again&quot;. The  voice will tell you.</p>          </td>

            <p><br>
              If the  voice has developed a spiritual quality and one finds later that is has lost  that spiritual quality, one must not be discouraged or disappointed. One has  not lost it. One must correct oneself and want to go forward again, and be  sorry for having gone backward, but never be discouraged, never be hopeless,  because it is there; it only wants a little touch. It is just like a little  candle which has gone out, but once you strike a match it is lighted again; it  is a candle just the same. <br>
              <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')"><br>
              The voice is light itself</a>. If the  light has become dim, it has not gone out, it is there. It is the same with the  voice. If it does not shine, it only means that it has not been cultivated. You  must cultivate it again, and it will begin to shine again.</p>
