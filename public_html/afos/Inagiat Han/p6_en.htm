It is not by sitting silent with closed eyes; for when the mind is giving attention to the body by thought or feeling, then the body is not relaxed, because the mind is torturing the body. And when feeling is giving attention to the mind, then the mind is tortured. And this torture, even if the eyes are closed, even if we are sitting in a certain posture, does no good. With  relaxation one should consider three points of view: the point of view of the  physical body, the point of view of the mind, and the point of view of the  feeling. The point of view of the physical body is that one must accustom  oneself to get power over, or to have influence on, one's circulation and  pulsation; and one can do that with the power of thought and with the power of  will together with breath. </p>

                    By  will-power one can bring about a certain condition in one's body so that one's  circulation takes a certain rhythm. It is decreased according to will. One can  do the same in regulating one's pulsation by the power of will. No sooner has  the will taken in hand the circulation and the pulsation of the body, than the  will has in hand a meditation of hours. It is for this reason that sages can  meditate for hours on end, because they have mastered their circulation; they  can breathe at will, slower or quicker. </div></td>

                    And  when there is no tension on one's nervous or on one's muscular system, then one  gets a repose that ten days' sleep cannot bring about. Therefore to have  relaxation does not mean to sit quiet; it is to be able to remove tension from  one's system - from one's circulation, one's pulsation, and one's nervous and  muscular systems.<br>

                    <p>How does one relax the mind? The method for relaxation  of the mind is first to make the mind tired. He who does not know the exercise  for making the mind tired can never relax his mind. Concentration is the  greatest action one can give to one's mind, because the mind is held in  position on a certain thing. After that it will relax naturally and when it  relaxes it will gain all power.<br>

                Relaxation  of feeling is achieved by feeling deeply. The Sufis in the East in their  meditation have music played that stirs up the emotions to such a degree that  the poem they hear becomes a reality. Then comes the reaction, which is  relaxation. All that was blocked up, every congestion is broken down; and  inspiration, power, and a feeling of joy and exaltation come to them.<br>
                <br>
                It  is by these three kinds of relaxation that one becomes prepared for the highest  relaxation which is to relax the whole being: body in repose, mind at rest,  heart at peace. </div></td>

                It is that which they want to reach, for in it  there is everything. In that condition each person becomes for the time as a  drop that is assimilated or submerged in its origin. And being submerged for  one moment means that all that belongs to the origin is attracted by this drop,  because the origin is the essence of all. The drop has taken from its origin  everything it has in life. It is newly charged and has become illumined again.</div></td>
