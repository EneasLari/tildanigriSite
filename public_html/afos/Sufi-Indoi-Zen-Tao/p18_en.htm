  <p align="justify" class="style1">A woman undertook the  care of a monk. She made a shack at the edge of the woods; she fed and clothed  him.<br />
  Twenty years passed  and then she thought: "Let's see if my efforts were worthwhile or in vain." So  she sent a beautiful young girl, hungry for love, and she told her how to  behave. The young girl went to the monk, she approached him and confessed that  she was burning with passion and asked him to cool her down with his love. He  replied: "I'm a dead man". The girl leaned towards him, took his hand and  started to caress it. "I'm like a piece of dry wood", the monk repeated. The  girl gave up trying and returned to the woman.<br />
  "He should have  shown concern for your situation" the woman said. "He should have shown  understanding towards your torment. Zen isn't morals; it is infinite  understanding. So, were my efforts of twenty years wasted? She then went and  set fire to the monk's shack. And didn't even ask about him again. </p>
