<p align="justify" class="style1">The monk Tetsugen had a dream: to publish a book  in Japanese, containing all the sacred verses. Determined to transform this  dream into reality, he began to travel the country  in order to raise the necessary money. <br />
  However, just as he had managed to get together  enough money to begin work on the project, the river Uji flooded, provoking a  catastrophe of gigantic proportions. When he saw the victims of the flood,  Tetsugen resolved to spend all the money he had collected  on relieving the sufferings of the people. <br />
  Afterwards, he resumed his struggle to make his  dream come true: he went from door to door, he visited the various islands of Japan,  and once more he managed to raise the money he needed. When he returned,  exultant, to Edo, a cholera  epidemic was sweeping the country. Again, the monk used the money to treat the  sick and to help the families of the dead. <br />
  Undeterred, he returned to his original project.  He set off again and, nearly twenty years  later, he published seven thousand copies of the sacred verses. <br />
  They say that Tetsugen actually published three  separate editions of the sacred texts, but the first two are  invisible. </p>
