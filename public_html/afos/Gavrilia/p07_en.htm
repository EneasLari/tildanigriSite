        <td width="55%" class="style3"><p>&quot;In Friendship and in &quot;worldly&quot; Love there  should be a response. It cannot be otherwise. But Love as taught by Christ for  the first time, <em>is offered without  expecting anything in return</em>. This is the great, the vast difference<em>. In this Love, the Ego no longer exists. </em>Our  own self ceases to be. We give our love to the other as we receive it from God,  without any thought as to what he does with it... This is what is important&quot;.<br>
          <br>
- You mean the way Christ  loved.</p>          
          &quot;Exactly. And also the  way that quite a lot of people love today. All persons of God love in this way.  They do not love because they expect something in return from the one they  love. They love because if you cease loving you cease living. Those who have  not felt that, have of God at all. Not at all. Because they are concerned only  with themselves, all the time... <em>"You  see? I love this person so much and he does not reciprocate my feelings. I did  so many sacrifices for him"...</em></td>

      <tr>
        <td colspan="2" class="style3"> You hear such nonsense so often! It has  nothing to do with Love according to God, which <em>comes from the Source of Love, goes to the other and returns to the  Source</em>. Who am I to expect and wonder whether the other person loves me or  not? Do we feel <em>«in union»</em> with God? What else do  we want? <em>This is our sole purpose in  life!</em><em>&quot;</em></td>
