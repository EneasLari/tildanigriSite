I have seen it happen with my eyes, with the eyes of my mind - even at the  most difficult moments... When I was in India, jackals, a  whole pack of jackals, with their eyes glowing in the dark, rushed in my  direction in the jungle forest and God made me invisible to them, as if I  didn't exist. Wasn't that protection by the Angels? What do you think? After  such adventures nothing frightens me... And something else too. When we have  love in our heart, the Angels become our best &quot;colleagues&quot;. They are the  ones to come when, at times, we ask ourselves: <em>"Where am I to go now? What shall I find there"?</em> I travelled a lot  in my life and happened to move from one place to another, without any material  security, but always with the protection of the Angels. I used to say, as I  still do: <em>"I am going from something good  to something better"</em>. Always gladly, even if it meant something worse or physically  harder. <em>Because I know that it is in  God's Plan</em>. This is what you should do all the time, my child. No matter  where you are. No matter who is near you. No matter who offends you or upsets  you. No matter who loves you. <em>EVERYTHING  that happens is in God's Plan, and because of that you will love it...&quot;</em></p>

          <p>Yes. And we must become  aware of it. We must recognize it clearly. </p>
          Then, little by little,  God will grant us the holy power of Discernment to put it into practice...</td>
