                      <br>
When Jesus called me I heeded Him, for His command was more potent than my  will; yet I kept my counsel. <br>
<br>
When He spoke and the others were swayed like branches in the wind, I listened  immovable. Yet I loved Him. <br>
<br>
Three years ago He left us, a scattered company to sing His name, and to be His  witnesses unto the nations. <br>
<br>
At that time I was called Thomas the Doubter. The shadow of my grandfather was  still upon me, and always I would have truth made manifest. <br>
<br>
I would even put my hand in my own wound to feel the blood ere I would believe  in my pain. <br>
<br>
Now a man who loves with his heart yet holds a doubt in his mind, is but a  slave in a galley who sleeps at his oar and dreams of his freedom, till the  lash of the master wakes him. <br>
<br>
I myself was that slave, and I dreamed of freedom, but the sleep of my  grandfather was upon me. My flesh needed the whip of my own day. <br>
Even in the presence of the Nazarene I had closed my eyes to see my hands  chained to the oar. <br>
<br>
Doubt is a pain too lonely to know that faith is his twin brother. <br>
Doubt is a foundling unhappy and astray, and though his own mother who gave him  birth should find him and enfold him, he would withdraw in caution and in fear. <br>
<br>
For Doubt will not know truth till his wounds are healed and restored. <br>
I doubted Jesus until He made Himself manifest to me, and thrust my own hand  into His very wounds. <br>
<br>
Then indeed I believed, and after that I was rid of my yesterday and the  yesterdays of my forefathers. <br>
<br>
The dead in me buried their dead; and the living shall live for the Anointed  King, even for Him who was the Son of Man. <br>
<br>
Yesterday they told me that I must go and utter His name among the Persians and  the Hindus. <br>
<br>
I shall go. And from this day to my last day, at dawn and at eventide, I shall  see my Lord rising in majesty and I shall hear Him speak.</p>
