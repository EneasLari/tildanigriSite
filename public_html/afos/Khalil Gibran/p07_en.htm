                  <td width="65%" valign="top" class="style25"><p align="justify"><b>Mary</b> : (...) Now we  are here in this garden, a stone's throw from Jerusalem. We are here. And you know well, my brother, that  our Master would have you be with us in this awakening to dream of life and  love; and He would have you an ardent disciple, a living witness of His glory.<br><br>
(...)<br><br>
<b>Lazarus</b> : There  is no dream here and there is no awakening. You and I and this garden are but  an illusion, a shadow of the real. The awakening is there where I was with my  beloved and the reality.<br>
<br>
(...)<br><br>
<b>Lazarus</b> : I was  a stream and I sought the sea where my beloved dwells, and when I reached the  sea I was brought to the hills to run again among the rocks. I was a song imprisoned  in silence, longing for the heart of my beloved, and when the winds of heaven  released me and uttered me in that green forest I was recaptured by a voice,  and I was turned again into silence. I was a root in the dark earth, and I  became a flower and then a fragrance in space rising to enfold my beloved, and  I was caught and gathered by hand, and I was made a root again, a root in the  dark earth. <br><br>
<b>Mary</b> :   Oh  strange, passing strange! But my brother it is good to be a running stream, and  it is not good to be a song not yet sung, and it is good to be a root in the  dark earth. The Master knew all this and He called you back to us that we may  know there is no veil between life and death. Do you not see how one word  uttered in love may bring together elements scattered by an illusion called  death? Believe and have faith, for only in faith, which is our deeper  knowledge, can you find comfort.<br><br>
(...)<br><br>
<b>Lazarus</b> : We  were in space, my beloved and I, and we were all space. We were in light and we  were all light. And we roamed even like the ancient spirit that moved upon the  face of the waters; and it was forever the first day. We were love itself that  dwells in the heart of the white silence. Then a voice like thunder, a voice like  countless spears piercing the ether, cried out saying, "<b>Lazarus</b>, come forth!"  And the voice echoed and re-echoed in space, and I, even as a flood tide became  an ebbing tide; a house divided, a garment rent, a youth unspent, a tower that  fell down, and out of its broken stones a landmark was made. A voice cried  "<b>Lazarus</b>, come forth!" and I descended from the mansion of the sky to a tomb  within a tomb, this body in a sealed cave.<br><br>
(...)<br><br>
<b>Lazarus</b> : It is  all so different across the valley. There is no weight there and there is no  measure. You are with your beloved. <br><br>
(a silence) O  my beloved! O my beloved fragrance in space! Wings that were spread for  me! (...)<br><br>
(...)<br><br>
<b>Lazarus</b> : To  wait, to wait for each season to overcome another season; and then to wait for  that season to be overcome by another; to watch all things ending before your  own end comes-your end which is your beginning. To listen to all  voices, and to know that they melt to silence, all save the voice of your heart  that would cry even in sleep. <br><br>
<strong>The Madman</strong> : White  bird that flew southward where the sun loves all things, what held you in  mid-air, and who brought you back? It was your friend, Jesus of Nazareth. He  brought you back out of pity for the wingless who would not be along. Oh, white  bird, it is cold here, and you shiver and the North wind laughs in your  feathers. <br>
<br>
<b>Lazarus</b> : You  would be in a house and under a roof. You would be within four walls, with a  door and a window. You would be here, and you are without vision. Your mind is  here, and my spirit is there. All of you is upon the earth; all of me is in  space. You creep into houses, and I flew beyond upon the mountaintop. You are  all slaves, the one to the other, and you worship but yourselves. You sleep and  you dream not; you wake but you walk not among the hills. And yesterday I was  weary of you and of lives, and I sought the other world which you call death,  and if I had died it was out of longing. Now, I stand here at this moment,  rebelling against that which you call life. <br><br>
<strong>Martha</strong> : (with  reproof) You call our sorrow self-pity. What is your wailing but self-pity? Be  quiet, and accept the life the Master has given you. <br>
<br>
<b>Lazarus</b> : He did  not give me life, He gave you my life. He took my life from my own beloved, and  gave it to you, a miracle to open your eyes and your ears. He sacrificed me  even as He sacrificed Himself. (speaking unto the sky) Father, forgive them.  They know not what they do. <br><br>
<b>Mary</b> : (in  awe) It was He who said those very words, hanging upon the cross. <br><br>
<b>Lazarus</b> : Yes,  He said these words for me as for Himself, and for all the unknown who  understand and are not understood. Did He not say these words when your tears  begged Him for my life? It was your desire and not His will that bade His  spirit to stand at the sealed door and urge eternity to yield me unto you. It  was the ancient longing for a son and a brother that brought me back. <br>
