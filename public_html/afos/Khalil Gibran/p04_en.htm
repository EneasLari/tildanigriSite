                  <td valign="top" class="style25"><p>ONCE MORE I would speak of Him. God gave me the voice and the burning lips though not the speech. <br>
<br>
And unworthy am I for the fuller word, yet I would summon my heart to my lips. <br>
<br>
Jesus loved me and I knew not why. <br>
<br>
And I loved Him because He quickened my spirit to heights beyond my stature,  and to depths beyond my sounding. <br>
<br>
Love is a sacred mystery. <br>
<br>
To those who love, it remains forever wordless; <br>
<br>
But to those who do not love, it may be but a heartless jest. <br>
<br>
Jesus called me and my brother when we were labouring in the field. <br>
<br>
I was young then and only the voice of dawn had visited my ears. <br>
<br>
But His voice and the trumpet of His voice was the end of my labour and the  beginning of my passion. <br>
<br>
And there were naught for me then but to walk in the sun and worship the  loveliness of the hour. <br>
<br>
Could you conceive a majesty too kind to be majestic? <br>
And a beauty too radiant  to seem beautiful? <br>
<br>
Could you hear in your dreams a voice shy of its own rapture? <br>
<br>
He called me and I followed Him. That evening I returned to my father's house to get my other cloak. <br>
<br>
And I said to my mother, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth would have me in His  company.&quot; <br>
<br>
And she said, &quot;Go His way my son, even like your brother.&quot; <br>
And I accompanied Him. <br>
<br>
His fragrance called me and commanded me, but only to release me. <br>
<br>
Love is a gracious host to his guests though to the unbidden his house is a  mirage and a mockery. <br>
<br>
Now you would have me explain the miracles of Jesus. <br>
<br>
We are all the miraculous gesture of the moment; our Lord and Master was the  centre of that moment. <br>
<br>
Yet it was not in His desire that His gestures be known. <br>
<br>
I have heard Him say to the lame, &quot;Rise and go home, but say not to the  priest that I have made you whole.&quot; <br>
<br>
And Jesus' mind was not with the cripple; it was rather with the strong and the  upright. <br>
<br>
His mind sought and held other minds and His complete spirit visited other  spirits. <br>
<br>
And is so doing His spirit changed these minds and these spirits. <br>
<br>
It seemed miraculous, but with our Lord and Master it was simply like breathing  the air of every day. <br>
<br>
And now let me speak of other things. <br>
<br>
On a day when He and I were alone walking in a field, we were both hungry, and  we came to a wild apple tree. <br>
<br>
There were only two apples hanging on the bough. <br>
<br>
And He held the trunk of the tree with His arm and shook it, and the two apples  fell down. <br>
<br>
He picked them both up and gave one to me. The other He held in His hand. <br>
<br>
In my hunger I ate the apple, and I ate it fast. <br>
<br>
Then I looked at Him and I saw that He still held the other apple in His hand. <br>
<br>
And He gave it to me saying, &quot;Eat this also.&quot; <br>
<br>
And I took the apple, and in my shameless hunger I ate it. <br>
<br>
And as we walked on I looked upon His face. <br>
<br>
But how shall I tell you of what I saw? <br>
<br>
A night where candles burn in space, A dream beyond our reaching; <br>
<br>
A noon where all shepherds are at peace  and happy that their flock are grazing; An eventide, and a stillness, and a homecoming; <br>
<br>
Then a sleep and a dream. <br>
<br>
All these things I saw in His face. <br>
<br>
He had given me the two apples. And I knew He was hungry even as I was hungry. <br>
<br>
But I now know that in giving them to me He had been satisfied. He Himself ate  of other fruit from another tree. <br>
<br>
I would tell you more of Him, but how shall I? <br>
<br>
When love becomes vast love becomes wordless. And when memory is overladen it seeks the silent deep. <br>
