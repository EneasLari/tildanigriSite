          <p><span class="style6">A</span>nother day, dark inside and out. Fifty  years on this earth and I still haven't tamed my emotional instability. As far  back as I can remember, everything contributes to my disposition sometimes going up  and  at others going down. Even dreams predispose my day. It's also this weather being grey and drizzly ... <br>
          </p>
          At such moments I feel cut off from everyone and  everything. I become as dark as the weather and all my aims withdraw. As if  faith decreases and the mood for escape increases. We all go through  such situations and they are really unpleasant. I don't know the meaning and I  don't see signs for the continuance of the way. Everything is confused in the mind for as long  as the mood is shadowed by my pessimism. Fortunately, the moments of such deep  depression are few, otherwise I think that I wouldn't differ from the past.  It's these moments I don't have the courage to materialize what is in my mind.</div>          </td>
