                      awareness and experiences! He was always on our path, but we simply were not ready to accept Him
                      ... Now everything seems natural, whereas in the past we would have thought that something was
                      wrong with our mental balance ... So, do you see how methodically the truth is presented to human
                      beings? How can you not believe, how can you think that everything might be a deception?<br>
                      <br>
                      The weather has softened, expectations have mellowed, hope has taken on a colour! Our hearts are
                      becoming increasingly larger, and thus accommodate more people, becoming more and more pure and
                      so, through their filter, they purify whatever is desperately trying to infect them. Nothing is
                      able to pull them back! <br>
