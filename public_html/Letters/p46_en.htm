The family, for instance, I wonder why it's needed, since it simply  imprisons you with concepts which you magnify according to your emotional  structure ... and yet how many people could stand living without this delusive  pattern? How many would continue this ruthless struggle, without a concrete feed  back? I think that  few would be able to go on, to defy this, without  asking "What's the point of all this?"<br>

              That's why almost everybody  enters  the logic of self commitment again and  again ... in the need for the furled  wings to allow their "young" ones to fly more easily ... and so, through the flying  of  eagles they too find interest  for their own course, which can be  slow but is less boring: the stimulus has the power to make you think that  it's worth the effort, because it's the effort of the many ... an effort that  everyone understands better ...</p>            </td>

        <td colspan="2" valign="top" class="style5"><div align="justify">Our great need for  security and the mistakes that follow because of it, seems justified if one considers the  wonderful calmness that we renounced by choosing the road of descent. The constant  search for joy, which we seek on earth in vain, doesn't surprise me if I think  that joy is impossible before returning to Him. The inexhaustible divine  energy, which never starts or ends, is irreplaceable, however  intensely one tries to do so. The enormous energy eye, which is continuously  fed with light, has no face, neither can anyone touch it, see it, analyze it.  It's a huge nothing that actually fulfils everything. This  is also the opposite  of what we consider lack here on earth ... On earth by nothing we mean the  absence, the lack, the "colourless" ... This term is exactly the reality of God:  nothing = presence ... completeness ... clarity. </div></td>
