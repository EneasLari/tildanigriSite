                stopped making a fuss, in case they ruin the beauty everybody is looking for, usually in the wrong way
                ... Even my animals are so quiet, as if they are meditating. I wonder how far their instinct
                reaches...<br>

                I feel like a guest in this place, but where is the host? I'm doing everything I can in order to please
                him ... but again I don't think it is enough ... I don't know how much time I have left ... But when I'm
                standing in front of Him, I want to look Him deeply in the eyes, I neither want to feel fear nor shame,
                I simply wish to tell Him that I have taken care of &quot;His House&quot; the best I could. But even
                this is not enough for me ... What else do I want? <br>

                don't throw away anything that I'm writing to you any more, because I know that nothing is wasted.
                Everything is equally beautiful and ugly at the same time as long as you reach nowhere. With love, once
