That's why it  takes me so much time ... It's very difficult to love what upsets you, what  you consider ugly or an outsider ... In that case you find it difficult to love: what  you don't want in your life, so you don't understand it. <br>
              <br>
          It takes time for the heart  to fit in the love of the unpleasant ... so we love our  man/woman but we want to chase out of him/her whatever "evil" is eating him/her  ... </p></td>

Only then will love be solid and so its power will drive away all the  shadows of the beloved's life. Deficient love never has the same capacities,  simply because it is not love. Under conditions, there is no such thing as love. When  someone loves he is EVERYTHING. Otherwise, the "approximate" and the "almost" are  familiar to the human perception of love.</p>
          <p align="justify" class="style5">I grow up slowly ... but I  grow up alone ... no one hurries for the outcome. I grow up by abolishing and  this is the truth of my age. Nevertheless, some things remain the same and  unchanged ... like tolerance and patience towards the people I found beside me,  without remembering having chosen them ... They're the ones who need a struggle to get  close to  and infinite patience to accept. I'm saying this because I  believe that the pattern of relatives  is all you've brought with you to solve ... 
it's what you're asked to finish, because they came so close for you to be able to see  that everything can be done when there is love.</p></td>
