Life seems long because it is usually full  of disappointments, bitterness, loss. Few are the joys, just as many so as to make us able to endure whatever we would otherwise abandon without a second thought!</p>

These eyes, the earthly  ones, have a different job here, where they are, but definitely they see   infinitesimally compared to the true and eternal eyes, the eyes of the soul.  These eyes that we carry with us when we come for a specific deed here on  earth, have little potential, if we aren't able to illuminate them with the glints of a  different perception, which is unproven, but a substantial one and is as real  as this life which surrounds us. </p>
          <div align="justify">When I talk with you I talk with Him; I don't hold  anything for me because nothing is mine anyway. But  it happens that only with you do I want to strip my existence, without censoring anything. I'm waiting for  you with love and the need for my eyes to see you, which still ask for evidence  in order to be happy.</div></td>
