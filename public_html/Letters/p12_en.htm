Thoughts, sweet sorrow, the need for a beloved voice ...  Simple earthly desires after a day's fatigue in order to make it through   daily matters and to observe ...</p>
          <p align="justify">When we move to a higher level we lose beloved ones,  because they cannot endure our vibrations, which are mysterious because they have changed so much ... No one is to blame in this case (as  always). This is proof once more of  the absolute loneliness of the  Path. I am sure that we have never  thought of the "collateral damages", because the journey was so exciting!!  </p>          </td>

          <p align="justify">Life goes around in circles and so does the day, the  thoughts, the feelings. Our love is a circle, which at times we think  can  grow ... but it doesn't work this way. It just remains the same, the only  difference is that some people can't take it. They can't take the stability,  the known, the unchangeable.   <br>
              <br>
            They need an accomplice in their changes because  they can't tolerate themselves. It is hard to understand what you don't have,  what you are not. What you consider as an insufficiency is difficult to suffice  you, and even harder when you know within that this "insufficiency" is  wholeness! Then they struggle to lessen you so as to reach you ... but all in  vain. The house is solid and comfortable, it can even house them too.  <br>
  <br>
            Deep disappointment for the unconscious attack. Back  to the place appropriate for each one. Too bad, because they could gain momentum from ours. I hope one day they get on the same wagon as us, where  everything is ready and they will just relax by our side. And if they don't, it  won't have been us who shut the door. Life might want to lengthen their journey. <br>
          </p>
          <div align="justify">It is painful to find out how little the people close to you, know you ... but  it is also liberating, because it puts you on real and more genuine paths.          </div>          </td>
