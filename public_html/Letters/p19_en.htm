They don't leave us without work ... it seems that  the "road" has been accelerated ... so that we finish with the "small", which of  course are big! Big, for  those who know how to observe.

I tell you with certainty,  though, that sorrows send you violently ahead, whereas "pleasures" leave  you stagnant. But still, this is what we all seek, because ultimately we know  the difficulty of the road of knowledge. Fortunately, of course, in the end we don't determine it ourselves not consciously anyway. It is very easy to lose oneself in the "pleasures" of the body and   matter. I know very well how much power and control the moments of  pleasure carry!</p>          </td>
