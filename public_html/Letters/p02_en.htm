Consequently, never exaggerate when defining your wishes because it is as if  you have killed them before they are born. You simply, are. OTHERS  determine the important things of your life since the only important thing for  you is YOUR existence ... through HIM ... only HIS joy is real, everything else is  patterns of your mind, deceptive ones.</p>

This is just another of  our many illusions. Why  do I get carried away even though I already know that? My ups and downs become  insignificant when I don't give them emphasis; therefore I'd better tune in  to another station and that's it.</p>          
          <p>We all seek the reason for our existence and  when we find it we once again seek other things, more difficult and deeper ones. So,  peace of mind never comes and we are left with a subtle uneasiness and sorrow. When  shall we finally discover what our eyes and our senses cannot spot?</p>
          <p>Now everything in my life has a different  colour and a different value. Whatever I took for granted, now seems to have been given to me for the first time. Everything has a magical perfection and  everything radiates a unique light and colour as if freshly painted.</p>
          <p>There are infinite paintings of  unbelievable beauty around me, which I simply did not see in the past...</p>
