It is the time I've finished my daily chores and the veranda is filled with   presences ... My small trees have grown  quickly and I'm gazing at them while watering  them and I talk to them mentally, anyway, let's not go crazy over this! This  time of day always suits me best ... I'll never get tired of repeating it while thinking of anything related to the sunset. How people resemble  dawn, dusk and   noon. </div></td>

          <div align="justify"><span class="style5">This is how we all are at some points of our course ...  when  the afternoon has passed tensions are  appeased,  eyes are filled with nostalgia, thought travels more easily in time,  the past and the future lose their old meaning.</span></div>
          <p class="style5">The vessel that carries us  slows down and so you can see, hear and reflect ... when you move slowly you  have enough time to see what you once passed by ... the speed of youth has  other priorities and the time comes to change the lens in your camera ... What's the relevance of all this that I'm writing  to you now? It is certainly relevant ... Now I have reached the point where I'm  walking "the rest" of my life on earth ... how long will that be? </p>

        <td colspan="2" valign="top" class="style5"><p align="justify">It is therefore natural to find time for some real  thinking. It is natural for the senses to have the colour I used to see as a child, for intuition to have its old capacities ... it is the luck of being  able to see and hear nature and thus  enter God's footprints more easily. There is  a way to approach everything. I function like an animal, through senses ... logic  helps me very little now, while in the past it used to play a key role in my  life. But what do I need it for now, that everything rational has been  reversed? <br>
        </p>
          <div align="justify">I talk to you every day, by writing. Then you always give me answers in  my mind. So, I ended up having you here all the time. Everything I missed is  here ... as long as I let myself go free to see ... people, conversations, beloved glances. Now  I am sure of the support of my loved ones. They are all beside me during the  nights of my illusive solitude. And I'm filled with energy ... they constantly  supply me, and my heart and mind are as if they are growing bigger, warmer and  are opening everywhere. Sweet companionship ...          </div>          </td>
