                it's because you don't love. The "but" is the mind, the &quot;I love&quot; is understanding ... It is
                there that you set yourself free, you admit, you obey! <br>

                don't need to agree in order to understand ... Understanding comes through what you don't approve of.
                Love does not need agreement of opinions. Try your love with your opposite ... Your like is you. We got
                here because we brought a ready package to go, so let's not get too excited ... the others have their
                own path, their own package, it is not their fault that we thought otherwise for them ... They are
                revealing their own truth now, so why should we get angry? Who deluded whom? </div>

                There is always help for them and us as well. It is just that we by knowing certain things, feel we have
                been done an injustice ... which by no means is true, because He gave us everything ... it's time we
                dealt with ourselves and let the others go their way, because by setting them free, we get rid of our
                own chains as well. Only in this way and by blessing them, will the "spell" be broken ... <br>
              </p>
              <div align="justify">The difficult path is for those who understand. However, consider how tough it is for
                them, who live close to people like us ... We are not diminished, we simply go along with them without
                making them feel small. This is the best way for them to distinguish the difference. Our example,
                without many words and theories, will teach them to walk. These are words coming from the soul,
                everything else is what we were taught to use and don't need anymore. It's time for reality. No more
                insidious emotions and anger for other people's disabilities. We remove even the slightest remnant of
                the lie from ourselves ...</div>
