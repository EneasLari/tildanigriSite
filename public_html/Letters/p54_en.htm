We are at the BEING, if  only it were decided that we will be incorporated in the ONE ... I don't know but  I felt the depth of truth touching me like a caress, and I remembered His light  that filled me beginning from my feet and ended filling my Mind ... that started  growing and left me with a sense of incredible peace and confidence ... The  short time this undeniable reality lasted, made me feel the importance His  Word has.</p>

I am happy that even for a while I had the  pleasure of entering His frequency, His light, His peace, which I never thought   could possibly  exist on this earth! And yet, now I know that with His  grace we can function from here too at His pace! </p>
          <div align="justify"><br>
            In fact, somewhere there where I went, His way exists! I knew it then as well,  it's only that it was so short, just enough to let me know it. For a short  while I became a huge ball of light, so for the first time I thought that only this  is  reality!! For a short moment I became what I am, that is to say what we all  are ... Perhaps the time has come for us to feel this joy ... maybe as simple as  that in "our life" or maybe in another way, which is carefully being concealed.          </div>          </td>
