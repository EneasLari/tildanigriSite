And this is also how I find you in my peace and quiet, by inhaling the air or  when my glance is lost in the nowhere of my being. I reach you as a  feeling and suddenly I stop being alone ... this is how it's done, the wind  brings you here and it's also the wind that takes you away. But neither  far  away  nor  near exists, only  circular now, that's why it's an  illusion that we're lost ... we never got lost in reality, it was simply that we got together  with difficulty.</p>

              <p>This is our relationship, in the end. It's the same  memories, the very same logic of things, the same feeling of the somewhere else of  the Beginning of our relationship! We are neither from here, nor are we totally here,  the other place that brought us, claims us ... determines us ... controls our  thoughts and our emotions. This emotion that I have and this understanding is  not related to the experiences and the life I have lived on earth ... it's  disembodied, pure and genuine as Light! <br>

              When  thoughts are scattered and the body is intense, the space of  our soul is small for the size of divine Love. And this space is created with  pain or absence many times. When you seek God, you drive away from yourself whatever makes it difficult for you to find him,  unintentionally of course. The  quest brings different people close to you, fewer but more essential.</div>
