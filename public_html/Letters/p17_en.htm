          <p>I was given strong emotions at a time of continuous questioning. It was  then that I let my body work without tiring my mind ... I wanted to punish my  romanticism and my difficulty to forget what I thought betrayed me... </p>

Though soon whatever I did came back upon me, spoiling even  those "authentic", as I called them, moments. My escape became a prison since  it didn't offer me peace. And peace needed time to return, as I know now, and  not a sexual relief that lasted for such a short time as to lead me astray into  wrong assessments. <br>
