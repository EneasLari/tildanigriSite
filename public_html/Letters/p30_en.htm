              <br>
          Now we are struggling to put aside the mind with its  exaggerations and strengthen our intuition. Intuition which we have so much neglected  and therefore it abandoned us, refusing to return as long as we underestimate  it. What could it do when its place always remained empty? How could it fight  the rationalists? <br>
  <br>
          It's time for me to learn how to keep silent! Only  when I keep silent do I discover myself! Only then are my concerns appeased,  only then will my veins stop pulsating, because the conflict ends and  everything is nature ... God, I am all! <br>
  <br>
          There is no need to keep records ... no need to think.  All you need is silence ... without sight ... without sound ... only silence, which  places you in its tracks and takes you wherever the mind can't  go, the eyes don't see, the ears can't hear.  <br>
        </p>
          <div align="justify">Silence, a priceless treasure, often elusive under the circumstances we  have learned to live with. Too much talk over nothing. Too much description  without any meaning!        </div>          </td>
