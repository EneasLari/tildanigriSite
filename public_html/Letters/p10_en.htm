                no word with an extreme meaning lasts forever. The only words with duration are those such as "I think"
                or "maybe". "Never" does not exist and surely nor does "nothing". This is what I say now, but perhaps
                tomorrow things will be different. I constantly invalidate myself, it seems that this is my time, me who
                thought that I had reached a certainty. How ironic is that ... </p>

                  fabricate in order to believe that I had found it. It took me a lifetime in order to understand the
                  illusion of my desperate seeking ... Thank goodness I didn't leave without feeling the truth. This
                  life for you, for me is a preparation for whatever is going to follow ...  this life is the starting
