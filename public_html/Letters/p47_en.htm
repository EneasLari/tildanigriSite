Everything we had thought so far, everything we loved or pushed away was none other than virtual  reality. Otherwise, we wouldn't have reconsidered ... time and effort are needed  for the revelation. And do you know something? you need guts as well, guts above  all. How many can endure falling apart? What's the meaning of the revelation for  the majority? Mostly the struggle is to preserve our lie. How many people deal with  their truth?<br>

Everything else that we once magnified, covering needs, shrank, became as small as  they once had been, leaving us only the true values that we rediscovered after the  madness of youth ...</p>
          <div align="justify">Our life, anyway, has taken His form. It's  difficult to compromise for something less. This must be enough for us and we  should have endurance for the continuation. Nobody assures us of the outcome  because it's not needed, the only thing I know well is that you never lose what  you've deeply loved. And this is what He defines and gives. He was generous and  open-handed to us. Let's have faith that He will take care of everything, heal  everything. </div></td>
