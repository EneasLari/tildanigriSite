                the True Initiate "* I keep on wondering where the truth lies ... if one thinks how hard it is for
                someone to "earn" initiation, he feels the difficulty of the life we are living. I don't really know
                whether what we're experiencing is the "initiation". But it should be so, because what's the purpose of
                the exercises otherwise? In the "first classes of the school", where you placed me, everything seemed
                beautiful, easy, understandable ... Now it's as if I am back in kindergarten ... and again it seems hard
                to me ... </div>

                  but if someone considers how unready our nature is, perhaps a little comparison may arise.</p>
