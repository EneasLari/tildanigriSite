              <br>
          As for us, we have not yet reached the state of "I am" ...  because when you "are" you don't need to mention it ... We seek  the shadows  of our truth ... For that to happen we need to set ourselves free in our own  reality, without relying on rules given to us, no matter where they came from ...  The truth is worthy when it comes effortlessly, out of nowhere, because it only springs from  within us, without any external intervention. <br>
  <br>
          Symbols are given to us so that we start working,  by admiring some people who gave light and wisdom to the world. On the way we  let all the symbols go and find our own truth. This truth cannot be explained  because it IS and whatever IS neither needs rules nor any explanation.</p>        </td>

I hope that Life and Truth come afterwards, because the war,   sweetheart, has crushed us!          </div>          </td>
