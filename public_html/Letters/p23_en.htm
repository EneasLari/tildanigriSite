Then I calm down and His thought simply leads  me and the end calms me down ... which is nothing but the beginning of His  path. Everything is a path, everything is a point of departure and a finishing  line at the same time ... my inner unrest is earthy but also profoundly celestial  and whatever makes me that way, is that I don't reach anything as long as my feet  are firmly on the ground.</p>          </td>

              <p>And now let's go to matters that are made of the  absolute, such as the truth that we are seeking in the Texts, in the  Masters' language! It's only there that the spirit rests and only there does it  realise the real Truth! <br>
                  <br>
                How sweet life actually is when you become conscious  of its aim. Then it has a softness that makes you see even the troubles with  different eyes. With this hidden eye, which  with difficulty sees, it is  truly fortunate if it opens at some point. <br>
              </p>
              <p>Detachment means better quality contact with the person who suffers ... not  abstinence but only the correct approach and  the opening of the soul so that he  fully understands how much we care for him,  without anything cheap, without anything clouding the crystal clarity  of our love.</p>
              <p>The problem of our beloved  friend is that she is used to having everything. She does not remember that in  order to have everything, we must have nothing ... You understand what I'm  saying, please communicate this to her. </p>
