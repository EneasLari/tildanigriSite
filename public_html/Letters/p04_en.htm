This is what one learns by living and walking in the path of  His choice. The worst thing would be  for us to remain still. Only the Masters  remain still, who have solved the small and have discovered the eternal truths  which have not been altered through time and space, because the Masters exist  beyond and above them.</p>

You expand, so you encompass everything, you shrink, so you fit  everywhere. You gradually fight your selfishness until you extinguish it and  therefore you cut your ego into pieces. It is your ego that is making it difficult for you to  rise and discern the likeness within each and everyone. How much do we humans do  within one and only life ... still we often think that nothing is achieved, that  we haven't done anything well because this whole work is invisible<strong>,</strong> it doesn't have material substance...</p>          </td>
