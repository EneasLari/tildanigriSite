                  its inhabitants. And yet, despite everything I feel and "complain" about , my heart feels a sweetness.
                  Sweetness and melancholy, the main characteristics of my mood ... tolerance and understanding, the
                  final result of any discontentment after it has settled down ... </p>

                  ... this has become part of me, I don't think it is otherwise ... He speaks in my mind and keeps
                  silent in my soul! <br>

                I miss you, in order to speak, to come out of the deception of my absence ... I ended up talking only
