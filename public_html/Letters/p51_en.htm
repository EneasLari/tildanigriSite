            It's Friday evening, the sky is pouring with rain, watering and cooling the  turmoil of the earth with its inhabitants. And yet, despite everything I feel  and "complain" about , my heart feels a sweetness. Sweetness and melancholy, the main  characteristics of my mood ... tolerance and understanding, the final result of  any discontentment after it has settled down ... </p>
