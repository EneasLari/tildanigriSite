I still get bitter, I  still get into a bad mood. Every time I fool myself, because this is what I wish,  and every time I get disappointed like a child. I do not know to what extent I  should blame myself or was the lesson only for the other person ... this will be certain  when I  truly become  simply an observer ... Then repetition will not be needed  for me, because I still "take the bait" ...</div></td>

Funny, how the difference in the way of thinking and perceiving things, brings  so much loneliness ...  Luckily though, this  doesn't last long and I can again find the uniqueness that exists  in  everything that surrounds me anyway. <br>
        </p>
          <div align="justify">At other times, on the other hand, while we know the truth with  certainty, we become deeply disappointed when even the closest people are  revealed ...  So, here comes the moment of  revelation and not of a shift, as we often thought. Once again, as always,  the problem is clearly ours. A thin layer of darkness  concerning certain facets we maintained disappears, time for other things!!          </div>          </td>
