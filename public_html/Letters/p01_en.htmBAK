A brighter sun, a magnificent sea, competing with the colour of the sun, such inconceivable beauty ...</p>

            to turquoise seas where even the pebbles themselves look like doves.</p>
          <p align="justify">I feel amazing as if playing truant from the most difficult lesson of my school (mathematics). But in the end it's beautiful here in my isolation.<br>

          I can breathe, I see the sun, the sea, I can think ... So many thoughts,  sweetheart, so many questions, so many whys, but fewer "musts". I believe my life has become more meaningful, my relationships more functional.</p>
          <p align="justify">Now everything is so relaxed, to be led astray by time, so as to reach their desired point, which is none other than the place I finally guide them to, unconsciously ... I have so much love within, I send it everywhere to whoever accepts it ... if just a small amount returns to me I will be happy. This love suffices for the rest of my life and I'm sure that I feel my batteries full because of it. My life has never had so much light, so much laughter, so much love. How much did I have to go through in order to see with these eyes I have today, I wonder. So much pain, sorrow and tears for me to become able to distinguish the great truth ... I had been so primitive that I bent my head and it was  natural that I only saw the earth only and nothing beyond or above it.<br>
            <br>
            However, all this helped me to see things the way I see them now, everything helped to pick up deeper messages from other worlds, messages which I once thought to be incompatible and unreal...<br>
