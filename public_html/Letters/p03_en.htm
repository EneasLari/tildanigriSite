                allow myself to be free from everyday worries ... and then the welter of questions and insecurities
                furiously invade and catch me off guard. I feel like a stranger inside my own body, I'm not the person I
                believed I was, I'm a formless void of depth and perception, I search for an end but I can't even find a
                beginning.</p>

                nothingness, all my troubles are temporary excuses and my wishes are deceptions of the mind.
                Nevertheless, for the largest part of my life I lived with tension and great passions, being certain of
                the importance of whatever I set as a goal.</p>

                few years before? How many tempests does it take for you to arrive at the point of clearing up
                situations and needs which you had thought were supreme and everlasting ... how much effort, how much
                pain, how much anguish in order to see an otherwise simple fact as an illusion ... how many lives in
                order to become able to locate the illusion of the "great", of the "important" ...</p>
              <div align="justify">You know, honey, my life has taken an abstract form ... I think I have pinpointed it
                lately. In fact, lately, in general, I conceive notions in a different way. Whenever I think of a
                problem, I rarely consider it mine. I observe everything as if they were temporary situations and catch
                myself being calm, almost unemotional, participating from a distance. Surely, deep inside, we know that
                this is how things are, but my attitude still startles me ...</div>
