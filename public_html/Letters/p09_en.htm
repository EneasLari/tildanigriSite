Nonexistent are the joys when you have abolished the "here" but nor are you    elsewhere. This "in between", I think, is even worse than ignorance. Maybe our  demands grow and nothing is enough any more. Maybe our deficiencies seem more serious.</p>
          <div align="justify">How  could I not understand M.'s anguish? How could I not be hurt by the search taught  to her by many? But what hurts me  most is that she  also believes that she will find happiness in the "marriage-children" pattern ...  It's because people are not honest: they talk about all these things as if they are  the most important  events, even when deep inside they have revised their opinion ...  And even then, they are afraid to see their inner void; they are afraid to see  the deficiency in their life, and quite naturally pass on the  same longing to their children.          </div>

It's true that they are very  confused and perhaps they think that the formula might be wrong for them only... perhaps they never thought that the formula itself might be wrong ... In their lives  they have learned to do the same as others do and neurosis has become their  homeland ...</p>
                <div align="justify">Please,  God, keep our children away from wrong patterns. Whatever they do let them do  it with love, so pain may be sweet. Mistakes out of love become paths for  someone to find God, while the others drain you and you never bloom ... or, at  least, you bloom at a much slower pace. With love </div></td>
