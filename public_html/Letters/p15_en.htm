I  heard such a word this evening from a "stranger" and I was sweetened and  quietened. By this "stranger" I mean bearing no relation to the events of my  life, who certainly is not familiar with even the half of what's going on. I don't  want a reward, no ... I sometimes  need understanding, however. <br>
        </p>
          <div align="justify">Life is so difficult sweetheart ... the moments when someone listens to  our concerns and empathizes with our wounds, are rare ... What can I say ...  it seems that I'm growing older and my  sensitivity increases ... endurance gets weaker, my absolute attitude towards  behaviours and events is eliminated. </div></td>

        <td colspan="2" valign="top" class="style5"  ><p align="justify">I learn while aging ... fortunately, because people often  harden over the years. I became putty again as when I was a child, and this is  a good thing because I allow my shape free. Until I leave, I may change into a  thousand forms, but it will always be me since all my experiences will be  shaping my form which will be slowly approaching transparency. Only through it   the many people close to me will remember me the way they had learned to see me. <br>
        </p>
          <div align="justify">But what does it  matter, because I feel I've taken up residence in their souls, which  are also without shape and body. In this way I am constantly beside them,  within their most valuable possession ...   their self ... I am their extension and they are what has expanded me.</div></td>
