Until consequently, some day, we will seek our self. But in order to find it we must get rid of emotional baggage,  sometimes a painful process,  it cannot be done otherwise ... then we remain  "naked" ... we are lonelier than ever and that is  true solitude: the solitude  of abstraction, removing things, ideas, people, feelings. We keep ourselves  only, knowing that everything else existed in order to bring us to this  Point.� </p>          </td>

I identify myself with  everything more than ever ... whatever I may see or hear seems known to me, as if  I have experienced it or I am experiencing it at that moment. Perhaps I am more  open, more tender ... especially to injustice which has   disturbed me  most ever since I was a child. </p>
