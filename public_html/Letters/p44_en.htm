                that occur ... however sometimes we think more of the details and not the essence ... Saturday
                afternoon, quiet and tender like the beginning of an important day ... While I was thinking of going out
                for a while, I preferred my own company, which is ultimately the best!<br>
                <br>
                All the noises of the day have abated and dusk is incredibly pretty, spring-like and sweet. I have the
                luxury of observing everything, now that the mind has calmed down and can think again of anything that
                makes it feel rested. </p>

              joys ...</p>
            <p align="justify">Everything seems like yesterday and I don't feel I have grown up ... and yet I don't miss
              them now ... I just think of them, I long for them, I love them. I have accepted their "absence" perfectly
              and I am sure it's best for them. I have lit a candle and I send love with its flame, I try to see their
              eyes separately so the light enters their soul directly. I send them my love, that hasn't ended or been
              altered by time. Somewhere, sometimes, I have the certainty of reciprocation ... other times they seem
              distant ...</p>
            <div align="justify"><br>
              I am exceptionally "beloved" these days ... maybe some openly protect me ... undisguised ... I feel like a
              child being caressed after much indifference ... so I'm telling you, I live the grace of the universe with
              joy!</div>
