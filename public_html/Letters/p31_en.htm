          <p>Just before falling asleep, as thoughts  were becoming hazy, I heard an "inner" noise as if something was breaking ...   automatically I woke up completely and my mind tried to understand what that  noise was ... but I knew deep down in me that this noise was from within ...  curiously enough I didn't panic ... I let myself go ... I detached myself from  whatever would go on from then on ...</p>

              <br>
              After a short while, I absolutely knew that I had undergone a small exercise of  self-control ... it was the first time I had observed myself being so safe and calm ...  it didn't take me long to sleep. <br>
