                rock bottom ... a grievance seized me to such a degree that the tears wouldn't stop. Help, I was
                shouting to God, because I was alone and could do so. I seemed like a lost child, broken by the ordeals
                ... My nerves were in pieces, my resistance was at breaking point, it wasn't easy to stop crying. I
                hadn't cried that much for a very long time. God hears me, God sees me, and the times are very few when
                I don't feel His eyes or hear His voice. This was one of those difficult moments ... it is over now ...
                it's gone.</div>

                in my third eye ... and in a little while, when I "saw" forests and a carriage speeding down a narrow
                country lane, I understood that I was seeing an old life of mine, without people in it. It's strange
                that I sensed danger and I saw the whole carriage disappearing! Does it remind me of my old
                capabilities? Does it bring the message that appearance and disappearance are the same? By walking the
                path I will sort it out ... </div>
