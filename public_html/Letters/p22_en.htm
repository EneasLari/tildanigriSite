                love I feel for you ... It is great but still immeasurable ...  it is wide yet still expanding. It makes
                me emotional and stimulates me in a strange way. This is the highest quality of love that I'm aware of,
                you are myself, that keeps on surprising me. This love has no boundaries or colour, and so it remains
                unchangeable. It doesn't have ulterior motives thus it is freedom! It is love in all its glory and lives
                forever. It is the way we should come to love all people some day. It is love that makes you feel
                wholeness because it is returned to you. I am fortunate that the time has come for me to become able to
                feel such a wonderful feeling for a human being ... It is the gift they gave me, after the great
                "losses" of my life. I am grateful for what they made me feel.</p>

                write to you, I do it in order to communicate better with Him (and obviously you are the reason I do
                it). He sent you to me in order to lead me to Him, the way my own perception demanded it ... </div>
