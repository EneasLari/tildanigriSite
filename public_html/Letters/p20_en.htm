Out of the blue, during the afternoon, I got the  answer I was looking for, persistently I admit. His presence in the house was  the confirmation that He is Here, because He is simply Everywhere. The fear  that had once again seized me, due to the known problem, made me see, even for  just a little while, only in an earthly way, only in a human way ...  <br>
        </p>
          <div align="justify">The eagle is my soul, the soul of the world that always sees and hears  everything. It looked at me in a mysteriously proud way and scrutinized the  place ... I felt a little fear. I thought that I had imprisoned such a wild bird,  that's why I rushed to open the door and slowly let it out ... </div>          </td>

        <td colspan="2" valign="top" class="style5"  ><p align="justify">It walked outside  my door, didn't leave, waited ... what scared me was the unknown part of myself,  the part that does not fear, is not material and has nothing else to accomplish ... </p>
          <p align="justify">The dream was one of the greatest signs I have ever  had ... However much I may get into situations, something always remains on the outside.  Sometimes unconsciously ... now consciously. My soul, the soul of the World has  been redeemed... and even though I might be a little scared because I still have a  body, that's the way it is!! <br>
              <br>
          The continuation will come, anyway, better  because we have grown up ... I think? Here I sit, writing poems about us ... I must have  been writing to you in the distant past and it wasn't over then, can't explain it  otherwise ...</p></td>
