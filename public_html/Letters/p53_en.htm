                  all around, show us the possibility of the Light. We are just before the final end of earthly
                  emotions. Afterwards Love covers all the other emotions with its wings and super brilliant is born.
                  Because when we are Love, no other emotion will fit into It. Emotions exist before love ... love is
                  not an emotion, it is pure nature ... It is heaven ... it is a vision ... How close we are really!</p>

                to me ... You were the presence that filled the gap after so many absences which broke my heart ... In
                my most difficult hours, an oasis was your company, a medicine were your words and courage was the  love
                we felt for one another ...</p>

                I've always known you, I just didn't believe the amount of joy I felt when our paths crossed. You were
                one of these gifts which Gods offer only to good children, that's why I'm grateful and I thank them. And
                I thank you too, because you wished to cross my path again. And life is worth it only for this, no
