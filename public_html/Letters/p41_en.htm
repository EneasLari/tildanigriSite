          <p>Reading this terrific book of <a href="../afos/Coelho/index_en.htm" class="la">Coelho's</a> and being in the shoes of Elias, how many times did I cry because this was our  life, everybody's life with no exception ... How the truth slowly and humbly  touches our souls, sweetens our fears, dissipates our guilt! Then, how human  God looks and how well  He edifies and guides us! </p>

          <p><span class="style5">Certainly, sometimes He seems  like a cruel Father in our eyes, but it's because we don't know the sweetness  of the "end", the tranquillity of the Beginning! It's because we don't  understand His patience and His love, because we only see and remember the  difficulties of our current path. Now that we doubted Him  we've come to the  point of believing Him in an absolute way... How could one not glorify His deed! </span></p>

        <p align="justify" class="style5">This book also ended,  leaving a feeling of its being two-sided  ... joy for the truth it carries and sorrow even for the  people of God  ... like  Elias was. Such a struggle, so much pain, so much  proof of faith and courage! </p>
