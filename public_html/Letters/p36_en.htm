This, by reflecting in the purity of your soul,  became a ball of germs, which called for a way out ... it had to break out in order to cease being imprisoned ... it took time for it to  develop, because you had made it strong, by contributing yourself to its  creation ... </p>
          <div align="justify">Don't ever give essence again to something, which only you can  exclude through your attitude. Before something becomes a "source of infection", exclude  it. You know how ...       </div>          </td>

So, you don't allow yourself any  room to breathe, and just before suffocating ... you rebel! But  then it's too late, because the enemy is in your body. Don't allow space for it  to fit in again.<br>
          <br>
          Set another pace to your life and be more selective. Nobody will blame you for  that. Those who are in real need, will find you and when they go away,  will not leave rubbish behind them, because they will respect your words and  your time. All the others think they need you, and by always finding the door  open, they forget to knock, and when they go away, they forget to close it. As a result  everything you took care of chasing out of them, (malice, jealousy,  self-interest), enters you.</p>
           
          <div align="justify"><br>
            The way you are, after every such  meeting, it is only natural you become a  sitting duck. Even on our excursion there were the "exploiters" of your  endurance. Little by little, everything will be fixed. Everybody should learn  to respect other people's silence. Don't waste yourself  without any cause.  You will be needed.          </div>          </td>
