        What meaning would life have if we knew what was going<br>
        to happen every single minute?<br>
        It would be the apotheosis of boredom.<br>
        How can we learn how to solve exercises at school,<br>
        if we know the answer beforehand?<br>
        That's why the <em class="yellowFont">"normal"</em> person seeks the unforeseen. <br>
        This gives him the ability to create.<br>
        "The Law of the Unknown Future" is called the law people<br>
        are submitted to and no one must violate it, he can't do it anyway.

        Nobody, no matter how great and strong he  may be,<br>

        It's better to go along with life in  harmony,<br>
        flow through things with the certainty a fish has,<br>
        when it lets itself go in the sea currents.

        It is everything in life to know how to  wait,<br>
        in order to act at the <em class="yellowFont">"right  moment"</em>.<br>
        What does this mean?<br>
        Well, it's time to cross out another word<br>
        from our vocabulary: the word "difficult".<br>
        There is nothing difficult, there is no such concept.<br>
        Something seems difficult to us,<br>
        because the right moment for it to be realized has not arrived yet.<br>
        We have not understood that we should wait,<br>
        that it's not the time yet. Why should we force things?<br>
        It's as if we hit our head against the wall.<br>
        And it's never the wall's fault. When the right moment comes,<br>
        the hardest thing becomes the easiest, simple,<br>
        it happens almost by itself.
