            The hyper-condensed power that the <em class="yellowFont">"stones falling from the sky"</em> have, is the energy sent to people by higher spiritual forces,<br>

              in the form of crystals - as other wands -, the  energy of which<br>
              is exhausted and must be charged by the source again.<br>
