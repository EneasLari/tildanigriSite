              In the Himalayas we connect to the spirit  of our ancestors,<br>
              which is always with us, their thought follows us whatever we do<br>
              and guides us in our explorations. The energy and vibration<br>
              of the ancestors  is Here and Now. Since there is no past,<br>
              present and future and everything  occurs simultaneously,<br>
              everything is concentrated into the moment we live.<br>
              Hence, ancestors are both contemporary and descendants! ...

                to assist in the evolution and change of the rest of us. They may have left earth<br>
                with their physical body, but they don't leave the ethereal field and  they are always here.

            We learn, in fact we remember the wise peoples who passed through<br>
            the Earth before us, like the Indians and the <em class="yellowFont">"holy lands"</em> of the Apache.<br>
            Today untracked lands no longer exist, the end of the first period<br>
            of the earth's history is being heralded, the old spirit of wisdom and knowledge is  fading.<br>
              Earth is going through a purely material period, a superficial one,<br>
              <em class="yellowFont">"today we are playing in meaningless shows"</em> ... But thanks<br>
              to the  secret plan of God, spirit will be imparted<br>
              to future generations, without ever  forgetting our spiritual roots.

        The reference to Pythagoras is not  accidental.<br>
        All souls on Earth know this Master, who has also<br>
        been incarnated other times as well - apart from ...<br>
        the well known one - and has helped people with his discoveries.<br>
        Pythagoras is a living reality,<br>
