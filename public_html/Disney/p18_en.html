            Well, guys, Donald made a round trip to Atlantis in a few  seconds. On the other hand, we need <em class="yellowFont">"many  light years"</em> to travel elsewhere. Finally what happens with the mystery of  Time? Haven't you learned, it's been solved! Time does not exist, it is an earthly Fantasy! Time is us.
            Easy to say, difficult to make it your own  and live with it. That is to say being in linear time and living in the  infinite as well... Ah! I found an example: it's like when I play games on my computer; I live in two realities  simultaneously, the virtual one, meaning the game and the other one, of my life  ...

            Journeys in Time - the return to the past<br>
            or the  future - is something natural,<br>
            like the gates and secret passages<br> 
            towards other  universes.<br><br>
            Now that's magic!<br>
            Time and space is the same thing! <br>
            Here's how we can understand it:<br>
            I see in my dream that my friend passed the exams.<br>
            After a few days  the results come out,<br>
            and the dream comes true!<br>
            Now, which of the two happened?<br>  
            Did I expand in time and see something in the future<br> 
            or did I expand in Space,<br>
            meaning that I went with my consciousness<br>
            where my friend is and so I found out?<br> 
            Finally, could they possibly be the same?<br><br>
            Everything happens simultaneously.<br>
            Can we, therefore, see ourselves<br>
            as they were in the past, but also<br>
            as they will be in  the future?<br>

        Everything happens within a single moment.<br>
        We have just come to Earth from the world of pure energy<br>
        and so we are more familiar with these realities than you, adults.<br>
        We, the children, bring the experience fresh;<br>
        adults get confused in the labyrinth of  the mind.<br>
        Time is the moment, Time is eternity.<br>
        So, why not discover on the Earth of the 20th century<br>
        that there is a region that lives in the  year 5000?<br>
        Besides, don't you think that everybody lives on Earth today?<br>
