				How can we start the journey on earth? <br>
            	How can we go into battle and not lose	our bearings?<br>
		        How do we bridge the gap between<br>
		        the world we left behind and the one we came to find? <br>
		        But, of course, we play and we play until we can't play any more. <br>
		        The energy of the game and the carefree spirit collects<br>
		        the building material of light within us so that we can build,<br>
		        a strong spiritual body later on, a strong human being.<br><br>
          		Often, while we play we lose all earthly feeling,<br>
	            we become distracted from our earthly present<br>
	            and slip ever so gently into a world of pure energy.<br>
            	That's how we carry the well-being of the ethereal<br>
            	to earthly life every now and then ...
