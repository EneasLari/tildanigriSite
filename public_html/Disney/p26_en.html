            It's D! In case someone didn't find it ... The truth  is<br>
            always simple. Truly, children, don't we also beat gravity<br>
            for a short  while, don't we lift our entire body from<br>
            the earth, when we jump up and down?<br><br> 

            With the aid of energy, the wise citizens of the previous<br>
            Earth charged the huge blocks of the Pyramids<br>
            and could increase their weight as needed in order<br>
            to sink easily into the earth.<br>
            In the same way, they could render the heaviest blocks<br>
            weightless so that even a young child could lift them up<br>
            as high as he wanted.<br>

        But what slaves? We wonder how they have achieved such smooth surfaces even on the hardest stones.<br>
        How come the joints between them fit so accurately there isn't even a crack the size of the thickness<br>
        of a hair between them? By beaming it with energy, the Masters dematerialized the excess stone,<br>
        or charged it when they wanted to increase its weight.<br><br>

        Mount Meteora in Greece is also an example of moving huge  blocks with people's mental energy.<br>
        The rocks stand there&nbsp; imposing remnants of another era, an  enlightened one, provoking us<br>
        to ask ourselves, stimulating our existential memory, reminding us of the limitless capabilities<br>
        of the human mind, just like  the Pyramids. Well, here the words "to move mountains" have a literal  application.
