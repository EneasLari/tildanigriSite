            We sing our love ...<br>
            Love is the divine force inside our body.<br>
            Some say that love is a sin or that<br>
            it does not comply with spirituality.<br>
            Do not ever listen to them because<br>
            the exact opposite is valid: <br>
            no one can become a spiritual person<br>
            if he does not pass through the sexual route,<br>
            because spiritual energy is itself<br>
            actually transformed erotic energy.<br>
            So, when we feel that we are in love,<br>
            it's as if our conscience expands<br>
            and we can face problems,<br>
            which previously appeared insurmountable.

              We surrender to passionate love and to love<br>
              and we let ourselves go in their power<br>
              with  the whole of our soul. We study<br>
              how to connect the cables of erotic energy<br>
              in the University of life here on Earth.<br>
              That is why we fall in love with passion;<br>
              because in that way only shall we learn<br>
              to make correct circuits without short circuiting.<br>
              Finally, we discover the simple and deep secret,<br>
              which was already known to us:<br>
              the material that protects the lovers each time<br>
              and smoothly turns the energy to the receiver,<br>
              is love, and this whole journey through all this falling<br>
              in love has this purpose:  within ourselves,<br>
              to one day be flooded<br>
              with the revealing and magnificent Love.

            No, not at all when it comes to love!!!<br>

            the identity of his/her soul as it is emanated,<br>

            We have humour in life and in love, because ...<br>
            humour affects the soul in a similar way as love does!<br>
            Because love makes you more available to recognize things,<br>
            to difference, to nuances and understanding.<br>
            Just as it happens to a small kid who is surprised by his daily discoveries<br>
            and this puts him in the mood to play and laugh.<br><br>

            Humour is the momentary reversal of the earthly time-space,<br>
            the form and all the limitations of man.<br>
            This essence of the reversal contained in the joke,<br>
            frees the soul as it suddenly coordinates it with its frequency.<br>
            As it is natural, the soul feels bliss, such a strong feeling<br>
            that manages to shake the body and make it<br>
            vibrate and sound out of pleasure, with  laughter.<br>
            While we laugh, the self is laid bare from the clothing of pretence<br>
            and for a short while<br>
            it is in the non-dimensional, time-less and non-space  situation.

            When did you last have a Love test?<br>
            Because Love says that when one asks for<br>
            forgiveness from the bottom of his heart,<br>
            the other forgives him immediately!<br>
            Because love has broadened his heart<br>
            so much as to for-give one more<br>
            behaviour which he could not tolerate<br>
            until yesterday.
