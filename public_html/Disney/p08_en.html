              The purpose of friendship<br>
              is the exchange of energy and feelings.<br>
              And how useless and sad it is to spend our energy<br>
              if it's not addressed towards a friend<br>
              or based on our hope of making a friend!<br>
              At some point, we'll reach a stage<br>
              of not thinking of "I" but  of "we",<br>
              and then we'll be ready to return Home.<br><br>

              In  difficult moments, when darkness shadows<br>
              the  tracks on the road, you'll always find a friend<br>
              to  light the way and  invigorate your soul.<br>
              No, we're not afraid of our feelings ... <br>
              It's  like suicide to abandon our emotional life.<br>
              We  are people who feel, <br>
              who intensely experience whatever happens to us, <br>
              and  this is what we identify with life. <br>
              Besides, that's why we underwent<br>
              so much trouble to come to Earth!<br>

              We  show understanding towards the negative attitudes of friends,<br>
              because we know the power material  things has over humans. <br>
              We're  waiting for their hearts to speak to them and,<br>
              at some point in time, to find what we ourselves have also found  - the priceless treasures of  Love ...
