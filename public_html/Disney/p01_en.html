          We cross space from one end to the other ... <br>
          Attention! attention! &quot;the non-existing tunnel&quot;! <br>
          When we're speeding, <br>
          the light builds up dark shadows because of our speed. <br>
          So, it is always lighter in front of us, <br>
          it looks as if a bright light is always shining<br>
          somewhere in front of us, wherever we go, <br>
          so the sense of a tunnel is created.<br><br> 
          So, from greatness we are back to basics ... <br>
          because it is time for us to penetrate the earth's density <br>
          and be born as  humans ... <br>
          Comrades, here's to a good incarnation and a good Return! ...

        Agh! Now we have to leave all this and get ourselves together ... inside a body, slow, heavy,<br>
        made of dense energy, with a pile of restrictions. No more super hearing. No more super vision.<br>
        So, here on Earth, at best we could catch ... short sightedness ...<br>
        But still, we love adventure and difficult contests and that's why we landed here to explore our Self. <br>
        We left the world of infinity and the unlimited movement, but it's worth it. <br>
        The benefit from the earthly journey will be great.<br> <br> 
        
        Starting with  incarnation, the energy feeds us until one day we've grown like a weed! <br>
        We lock the Reality of our existence and our homeland in our Imagination,<br>
        so that flashes spark out every time we need it. <br>
        It relieves us to hear people speak about this, like Disney for instance, <br>
        but we remember it like a dream, because the moment the sirens of our birth were heard,<br>
        a black-out was imposed. <br>
        Life on earth is no joke ... <br>
        It requires all our powers to be vigilant, <br>
        to be on constant alert, and have our undivided attention to get by ... <br><br>
        And we  will.<br>
