            When we are on the path of God,<br>
            no human threat scares us.<br>
            The Force is constantly by our side,<br>
            and it protects us.<br>
            All the people have It, but only those<br>
            who know it or believe it, can be sure.<br>
            If you have hidden something you love<br>
            in the store room and after a while<br>
            forget that it's there,<br>
            then it is as if it does not exist for you ...<br>
            This is how God is. We all have Him<br>
            well kept within ourselves,<br> 
            but if we do not remember it,<br>
            it seems as if we are alone. <br><br>
      
            Nobody can touch even one hair of our heads,<br>
            when God reigns within us. His beloved children have Him<br>
            alongside constantly, as their guard and assistant.

            Even when we "enter" a panic crisis,<br>
            we try to control our behaviour:<br>
            we connect with the Source<br>
            and the truth that we know, meaning that<br>
            there is nothing that can really cause us fear. <br>
            Self control is so very important,<br>
            because when we are able to dominate<br>
            any situation, all natural forces will obey us<br>
            and we shall be able to heal the body as well.

            Behold the greatness of the human soul and a superb way<br>
            to overcome our fear: even when we ourselves feel fear,<br>
            it's enough that a fellow human needs help ...<br>
            we immediately forget our own fear and jump to help him.<br>
            So we help him who feared and he helps us,<br>
            again for the same reason.<br>
            Anyway, think of a life exercise: to be chicken hearted<br>
            and be assigned with the post of a lifeguard! <br>
            The store of good in us transforms us<br>
            into fearless ones! <br>
            Oh God, what a great reward!
