        those who reached perfection in creation, the <em class="yellowFont">"infallible"</em><br>

        Exactly that the time is approaching when the hidden secrets<br>
        of knowledge are going  to be revealed to people.<br>
        Humanity has reached the point of having built such solid<br>

        so that they will not be in danger of being shaken again.<br>
        At last we have control in order to avoid self-destruction<br>
        from the power of knowledge already given to us<br>
        and also of  the one that will be revealed to us in the future.
