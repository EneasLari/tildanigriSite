              Are we little gods or is God little kids?<br>
              Since we have a common dream,<br>
              the dream of everybody on Earth: to become a  small creator,<br>
              to create out of "no-thing", to &quot;invent&quot;, just as God did. <br>
              So, that's why the &quot;Mayor's&quot; wish was for his people<br>
              to have more inspiration and free thought.<br>
              Because we will create a world within us when we realize <br>
              that the meaning of our existence lies within creation.<br>
              That is the only way.

                in this energy frequency we coordinate<br>
                with the divine vibrations.<br>

              Only our soul knows what it's gone through on earth; <br>
              anxieties and disillusions that were necessary <br>
              to go through in order to enjoy a simple juice! <br>
              That means we have secured peace within us, <br>

                then at the end of it we shall reach happiness, <br>
