            Really, on such an important<br>
            and difficult trip here on Earth,<br>
            who takes the wheel?<br>
            The best guide ever for our explorations,<br>
            day and night, is within us: Conscience!<br>
            This speaks continuously,<br>
            doesn't order or instruct.<br>
            We listen whenever we want!<br>
            Such freedom!<br>
            We can even get angry with it.

              If our Conscience was to give only one piece of advice,  this would be: <br>
              <span class="yellowFont"><em>�spiritual discipline conquers matter and frees the spirit�</em></span>.<br>
              It takes a lot of blood, sweat and tears as well as time<br>
              for someone to harmonise their life with God's Plan ...<br>
              He'll fall and rise uncountable times until he feels<br>
              that his life is consistent with the Laws of universal Harmony...<br>
              As we said, there is no rush ! For us, discipline is a pleasure:<br>
              we enjoy living in harmony with the rhythms of the universe ...<br>
              just like when we are dancing!<br>
              We go with the rhythm and leave ourselves free.

              The universe is strict and tolerant at the same time; <br>
              we know that it gives many opportunities. That's why,<br>
              we should remember, kids, that Conscience contains  only what<br>
              we have lived through. That's how we know what we know.<br>
              If we haven't gone through it yet, then we can't know it.<br>
              We have to experience this ourselves, not through other people.<br>
              If we remember this, we'll show tolerance to our young  friend <br>
              who stole because he didn't know it was wrong.<br>
              So we should  understand and not judge.<br>
              If we ignore this we will become aggressive and harsh<br>
              towards something that  tomorrow could happen to us.<br>
              You'll see further along what happened to Scrooge<br>
              because he didn't know something that he thought he  knew ...<br>
