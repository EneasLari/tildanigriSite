            Where do we "download" an idea from? Where does thought come from?<br>
            Who sends it? Cosmic rays of thought reach the top of our head like a soft touch.<br>
            When the energy of the <span class="yellowFont">"idea"</span> meets ours, a light  switches on above our heads.<br><br>     

            We download thoughts from the Source of universal knowledge just as<br>
            we download whatever we need from the  Internet. We surf with our consciousness<br>
            in the upper energy layers, where entities of the spiritual world live,<br>
            which we call thoughts and we grasp a  thought as follows: the mind relaxes,<br>
            gives space to the heart and the energy  is formatted into a thought.<br>
            Then, we launch the thought at lower levels - in  our conscious -<br>
            (as if it were a ship!) and work it out.<br>

            "<strong>The ray of thought</strong>" describes the same thing: a person passes<br>
            through it and thus the  mechanism of thought is activated within him.<br>
            The ray of thought can penetrate  the space of very distant worlds<br>
            and so a person's mind can conceive innovative ideas in inventions,<br>
            arts, but also inner insights for his evolution.

            Everything exists within the Light, but it's simply  invisible in the darkness<br>
            of our earthly eyes. Donald challenged Huey to discover something,<br>
            "implanted the idea", the question triggered the response in the little one,<br>
            and so the light went on! But even generally, when the solution to the problem<br>
            is "downloaded" in the mind, the broader  area where the thinking man stands<br>
            is illuminated. And someone who enters the room later, can grasp with<br>
            his sensors what had happened there... God enlighten  us!

            Telepathic communication - the language  of the souls -<br>
            is possible through concentration.<br>
            The main instigator of thought transmittance is the heart.<br>
            Ineffable thought is stronger because it remains<br>
            free from form and language restrictions.<br>
            It is pure essence.<br>
            But also anyone who wants to be receptive<br>
            to mental transmittances must constantly live his life<br>
            with dedication, concentration and crystal clarity;<br>
            a single moment's concentration is not enough.<br>
            This kind of concentration reminds us of wanting<Br>
            to make an impression and jugglery.<br>
            Let us commit ourselves to something more stable,<br>
            and let us enjoy exercises in difficulty.
