	  <p>I spoke to you of Eternal Life, and promised it to you. <br>
	    <br>
	    Well, now you can understand it: Eternity is the transition from the world of polarizations to the world of the One, Unchanging and Apathetic. Eternal life has nothing to do with time - after all, your scientists  also tell you now that time is something &quot;artificial&quot; (but we'll talk about that later) – and of course it is not placed somewhere &quot;else&quot;, after death, etc., but belongs to another level of cognition: it belongs to the space where nothing needs its opposite - or its absence thereof – in order to be defined, therefore where the Word does not exist, because the Word defines in this life, and through this it gives existence. So, I spoke of Eternal Life, meaning through the &quot;continuous life&quot; the abolition of death as &quot;absence of life&quot;. I abolished death and showed that the soul can eventually be reduced to a level where there are no pairs [i.e. Life-death (= lack,  absence of life)], but the final One. The qualitative change of the /e/ to /o/ (i.e. the  word [On] <em>(in Greek means Being)</em> stemming from the  word [En] <em>(in Greek means One)</em> shows precisely the qualitative difference of Polarized and Eternal Life. When the Being <em>(&quot;On&quot;)</em> breaks away from the conscience of division and duality, it will manage to return to the One <em>(&quot;En&quot;)</em> and then death will have been abolished as a polar/pair of Life, on the way which I showed by My descent into Matter.
