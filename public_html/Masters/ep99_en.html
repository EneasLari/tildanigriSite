	  <p>The &quot;I want&quot; and the &quot;I do not want&quot; belong to the same spectrum, just as love and hatred are emotions of the same quality. Love is not differentiated from hatred, as far as the general category is concerned, but its opposite, indifference. To love or to hate are differentiated as to the manifestation, but have a common basis which places them in the same category qualitatively: the intense and fervent occupation with the object. </p>
		<p>So, denial and affirmation may basically constitute a like re-action to something. Different reaction is not constituted in the opposite of each of the two concepts, but in the lack of re-action. Meaning, whether denial or affirmation, it essentially remains a reaction, while  refusal is wrongly regarded as lack of reaction. </p>
		<p>The change of a circumstance happens not when two different-extreme manifestations of action or emotion  (and their intermediate of course) alternate, but when this action or emotion is abolished as a general category. For instance, the man who is experiencing anger and expresses it openly, just like the man who has denied and repelled it, are in fact on a common level. </p>
		<p>It often happens that a person wants something and due to some concurring reasons he cannot have it, he then denies it and &quot;does not want it&quot;. He is still at exactly the same point as before. The situation changes as long as the &quot;I want&quot; and the &quot;I do not want&quot; cease to be strong within him. Then he feels that he &quot;neither wants&quot;, &quot;nor does not want&quot;. So more generally, the delimitation of the being as a being and a non being expands and is contradistinguished from the absence of the being. <br>
		  <br>
		  The being, either as actual being (positive qualities) or as non-being (negative qualities), falls into the same category. So, the non-being has an entity and a presence equivalent to the being.
