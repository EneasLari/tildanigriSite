		<p>I want you to rejoice today because today is a day of joy, a day of the birth of the bright, the true, the beautiful. </p>
		<p>Fear, about which I've talked to you so many times, falls away from your heart, that's why you must bless those people who through pain led you to redemption and happiness. </p>
		<p>Don't be afraid to rejoice, because the new joy is a divine gift which belongs to Eternity. Pain will vanish when you project the light of Knowledge upon it, until it is buried for ever in the space of non-existence. I'm not telling you that you won't feel pain anymore, but remember the illness of the Voice and its course towards the power. </p>
		<p>My beloved child, here are the seeds you sowed like a good farmer in the field God entrusted to you. Continue your deed, which is still much and difficult but creative and new. </p>
		<p>Bless the Moon which marked the time, because everything has the need of your blessing. </p>
		<p>Your fortune is My Love. </p>
