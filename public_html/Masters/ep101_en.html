	  <p>Don't become disheartened when you feel that you are being worn down by negative powers, because it is natural and expected that as humans you are subjected to such trials. The faster you leave them behind you, the easier you will be able to maintain the tranquility of God within yourself. </p>
		<p>Dreams are usually visualized thoughts; that is why night prayer is provided, in order to &quot;clear&quot; the inner world and prevent certain unfortunate thoughts from appearing. </p>
		<p>I also wanted to tell you that the constant intellectual preoccupation with the past may push towards <strong></strong>its repetition. So chase away the vile images, while there is time, and for whatever questions you have unanswered  simply trust God in order to receive answers, when the time is right. Don't continue to bring back the atmosphere of the past, because you charge your aura negatively and – remember – we said that &quot;the Universe is a huge photocopier&quot; ... Whenever similar thoughts or images preoccupy you, replace them with words of prayer or some other thought or activity, and deal with their conscious processing only when and if you feel you have returned to the balanced state of inner harmony and tranquility. But this you already know of old. </p>
		<p>Organize in your mind the word that will be able to face this situation directly and without preparation and be in vigilance. Voice it with trust and certainty as soon as the bad thoughts appear, and allow it to act reversely: from outwards inwards. </p>
