		<p>Desire is primarily the boost to evolution. Desire on all levels is one of the primary instincts, with which man has been co-kneaded, so that his evolutionary course is ensured. </p>	
	  <p>Being an instinct, desire is uncontrollable. Man ought to classify and evaluate his desires before he lets himself be led by them. </p>
	    <p>The lower self, which is not &quot;lower&quot; but less powerful, since it is pinned down in a compulsory time-space, with no overview of eternity and universality, must not be repressed because it is the one that constitutes the material realization of the divine element, and only through it, is it possible for the Spirit to descend and for the Definite Union to be achieved. Desires, therefore, which the lower self gives birth to, ought to be received carefully and under no circumstances should man put as his target the total eradication of this instinct – something which often happens and indeed in the name of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;holy&quot; intentions. </p>
	    <p>Before man gets to intervening in his functions in a regulatory manner, he should dedicate time to studying them, so as to understand how the whole Creation is made down to its smallest detail in an excellent, complete and indispensable way. </p>
	    <p>The struggle of the enlightened man must be directed not to uprooting every trace of the birth of desire from within himself – something that he will not achieve easily in any case, because Nature has almighty mechanisms of survival – but to choosing those desires which, through the Principles and the Laws, can lead him to higher levels. </p>
	    <p>The levels of the Hierarchy are several and not necessarily valuated in rungs of superiority; each one simply covers some other sectors and corresponds to other needs. These have been written already, and you can find them. </p>
	    <p>As soon as the Disciple acquires consciousness of his course, he has the tendency to want to disavow every desire, fearing that this is not possible to conform to the Principles. Renouncement from desires means the deadening of a part of Nature, and we must all become consciously aware that only through Nature can all-consciousness in God be achieved. </p>
	    <p>The descent of Jesus' Spirit down to the earthly world, came to show precisely how important earthly existence is – which some &quot;enlightened&quot; ones under the orders of a certain &quot;religion&quot; so easily and without thinking, but perhaps also with pride, disapprove of. </p>
	    <p>Life is not a curse, as some may think, and you ought to be particularly careful when you hear such exhortations. Seek none of that which you dream of in some other life, because they already exist here, and whoever finds them here, to him they also belong for eternity. </p>
	    <p>The desires that are born have various causes, endogenous (of this or of previous lives), or exogenous (influences from others). In all cases man must carefully examine their origin, and to where they are leading him. When desires conceal needs from which he cannot break away, they possess him, then the materialization of the desire must be postponed, until free will prevails – so then desire ceases to be a coercion - of man's spirit in the sole direction of its satisfaction. </p>
	    <p>The Disciple must ask, because only in that way can he activate the movement of the Forces towards him. As long as he does not ask, the Universe sends him only that which indirectly concerns him, but have been put into motion by other forces. That is to say, he receives only impersonal results and not personal. </p>
	    <p>Remember that everything impinges on man's free will and nobody, no matter how high standing he may be, can violate this Principle and move towards a person who has not asked for any such thing. Besides, only through this process, which constitutes a process of realizing the Unity and the Total Functioning and Co-operation, can man become capable of realizing the responsibility he shares in the Work of God's Plan and reap the fruits of the teachings and experiences which are necessary for him. </p>
