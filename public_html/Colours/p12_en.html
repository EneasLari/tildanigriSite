Within each ball there are seven smaller  ones, which vibrate as well, at a high speed. Everything is alive! The  blue-purple balls are "full", glossy and dominate the room, or more precisely  the field, which also vibrates with them.<br>

            <p>The coincidences  become more and more frequent towards significant and healing discoveries:  again I found the same figure in Leadbeater's book entitled "The chakras, A  Monograph". There he drew what he saw that existed everywhere in  space and  verbally describes the motion it makes, which is called spin in Physical  Science.</p>

            <p>              In the illustrated  edition of the book of  contemporary Physical Scientist <a href="../afos/Hawking/index_en.htm" class="la">Stephen Hawking  "A brief history of time"</a>, I  read in the chapter "The unification of  physical theories" about the hyperparticles and their movements. They're  depicted as spherules and their movement, or spin, is the same as the one I  see. Only under very special circumstances are the hyperparticles  visible and  certainly not with the powerful microscopes under normal conditions, because  they diffuse.</p>
            <p>In Greece, at  Pylos, where the deepest point of the Mediterranean Sea is found, a globally  unique experiment is held: only at that depth can the neutrinos (particles that  penetrate matter and are found everywhere in the universe), be measured and  their behaviour  examined, because on the surface of the Earth the presence  of other cosmic radiation prevents their detection. Perhaps from Pylos, from 4,000 meters under the sea, from the experiment called "King Nestor", may the final  answer come for the unification of all physical theories, of all knowledge ... Knowledge is waiting for us to  discover it.<br>
              <br>
              The contemporary physicist <a href="../afos/Grammatikakis/index_en.htm" class="la">George Grammatikakis</a> comments in the related article on  the Pylos experiment "... If, as the books say, King Nestor was wise, and if  his soul travels today, it would certainly rejoice because of this rare  conversation of the myth with science, of the past with the future, which bears  his name."</p>
            The "conversation of the myth  with science" will lead us to the Truth, because the myth is the truth told in  the words of another era. </div></td>
