          <td class="txt"><p align="justify">January 2002. We were at my friend's house talking. At  the same time I was looking at her aura, as it happens automatically now. So  far things were familiar.</p>
            <p align="justify">Suddenly, I saw something that I observed for the  first time and it made quite an impression to me. On her right, and completely  separate from her, I noticed the outlines of three bodies made of platinum  light. It was clear that they were ethereal forms. The middle one was a little  bigger. We can say that they stood still, shoulder to shoulder and were looking  at us. I felt the need to welcome them.</p>
            <p align="justify">Have I finally seen our guides, our Masters? Who have  I seen? The future will tell. I have confirmed to myself as well that the invisible space  is full of presences, friend-guards who are near us; they literally watch us,  listen to us and help us.</p>
            <p align="justify">Shortly afterwards I felt an inner certainty that I  had actually seen the Masters. My conviction was also strengthened by a  coincidence: in Barbara Brennan's book "Hands of Light" I found the presentation of  such corresponding forms. The actual depiction of this book that I show at the  bottom, presents the ethereal bodies of guides and it's very close to  the image I saw myself.</p>            </td>
