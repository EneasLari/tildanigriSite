                <p align="justify">Four years later, specifically on 30 August 2001, literally in a flash, I saw the
                  most fascinating thing I had ever seen in my whole life. We were on holiday at a beach. In the
                  evening, while we were sitting on the veranda, chatting with my friend, at some point as I looked at
                  her, all of a sudden - and who would expect it to happen in any other way - I saw over her head
                  exactly what is drawn in the sketch: two tubes made of light, a purple-mauve one and an electric blue
                  one. Inside them the light was endlessly vibrating and transparent, as I could see everything that was
                  behind them. I didn't ask myself, not even for one second, what it was I was watching. Within me I
                  knew that it was the aura.   <br>

            <tr>
              <td colspan="2" class="txt">
                <p align="justify">That moment a feeling of perfection overwhelmed me. I was watching a fascinating
                  light. There is nothing like it on Earth. The colours were vivid, intense, and the purple-mauve seemed
                  to be flowing out of the tube and cascading over my friend's hair.</p>
                <p align="justify">The two tubes reminded me of holographic ones and their size was as can be seen in
                  the sketch. The more I concentrated on the intense limpid light travelling through the two light
                  tubes, the more intense it became.</p>
                <p align="justify">Gradually, my ability to see it vibrating more and more vividly increased. This fact
                  assured me that the LIGHT exists; it even made that very picturesque landscape where we were standing
                  seem pale in comparison ... I thought, "Now I understand. This must TRULY be Apollo's Light", and
                  then, "THE INVISIBLE WORLD ACTUALLY EXISTS, but how can I share all this miraculous Light I am
                  watching right now with others?"</p>
                <p align="justify">Now I understand why people who think they believe, while they haven't really SEEN,
                  speak cruelly. And here is why people who have seen, remain silent: what could they say, how could
                  they describe the love that is born by the LIGHT? Who can understand what it feels like being in love,
                  if they have never fallen in love before?</p>
                <p align="justify">From that moment onwards I never wanted to stop watching the LIGHT. Now I feel I
                  really understand: why others languish and others are in ecstasy, why those that haven't seen are
                  scared and confuse the dark with the LIGHT, so many questions... Fortunately, the moment of the
                  "because" has come.</p>
                <p align="justify">Then, a wish emerged from deep inside me: to contribute to the relief of more souls
                  by showing them the way towards watching the Light.</p>
