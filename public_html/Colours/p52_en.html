                <p>July 2003. We are by the sea. A friend, &quot;A&quot;, visits us and we go  swimming together. She is under tremendous stress, which has caused her to break out in a rash  that makes her feel great discomfort after a while. My friend puts her hands  over A's  rash  and transfuses energy to her. I see a cloud, black in the  beginning, vivid red and opaque afterwards, coming out of that point. Then, the  place is filled with mauve light. &quot;A&quot;, who has the problem, relaxes, because  she's relieved and believes that she will get over it. The energy therapy is  accompanied by a refreshing ointment. Next morning, the rash is reduced and the  discomfort is gone.</p>
                <p>I know within that this has been attained because &quot;A&quot; had faith in the  success of the cure and had already started the process of thinking what was  wrong in her life in order to face it. In  recent years, I have come to know well that  everyone's enemy for his or her own personal development is fear, the vague and general  fear that consists of other countless individual fears. All of them are  figments of the imagination. The characteristic of fear is the paralysis of  reasoning and man's immobilisation. Nice trick, but  we have just understood that all this is nothing but a delusion and fear breaks  up just like a small cloud that has been pierced by the sun, A's black cloud broke up when the  "sun" of energy was transfused by her beloved friend.</p>
                The energy which cures  is Love. I know by now that we start learning it from the experiencing of our most simple  and everyday relationships, to the deepest love affair someone can have on  earth. And then something starts happening which seems like a miracle. We begin  opening our soul to the infinite, the universe, and we no longer feel alone in  this world.</div></td>
