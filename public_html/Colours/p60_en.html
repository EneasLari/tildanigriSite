                        <p>It's June 2007. Once again we are in our beloved place by the sea. I concentrate on my
                          friend. I see dots like stars twinkling around her head and above her a figure of light is
                          forming. I ask who is it and I get the response that it's her Guide. When we are in the
                          vibration of the spiritual world, there is no way whatsoever that we would face the Guide
                          speaking to us with scepticism. When we leave this vibration, the scepticism begins.  </p>
                        <p>During the moment my friend's Guide appeared, I felt it was very difficult to see the
                          spiritual world through such dense matter. Then I sensed that the Guide telepathically
                          perceived that I was thinking this difficulty and told me "<em>Continue</em>".</p>
                        I know from within that the great spiritual Beings "descend" and take some ethereal forms so as
                        to become visible to us, as we are in dense matter. I concentrate and try to see the features of
                        his face. He tells me: "<em>we do not have features on the face; we just take a shape to become
                          "visible" to you. It's the energies that bring us together</em>". When he appeared I felt he
                        smiled, although he didn't have features. He sent us love. The room was filled with green and
                        mauve light, which was thicker in some places and thinner in others, creating various formations
                        that reminded us of archetypal shapes. Then he sent me the message "<em>the Eternal doesn't
                          change, it always bears the same forms</em>" and he immediately turned into the shape of an
                        eagle.<br>

                        <p>My friend's physical form darkened, then it became mauve and the outline of this mauve light
                          reminded us of Tibetan figures, like Buddha statues. Around her the densification of the mauve
                          light's spin and its lightness created some patterns that looked sometimes like a hawk
                          sometimes like a cross and at other times like a non-identifiable Being, which might have
                          existed in other worlds, or on Earth. This is how dense matter is formed: first thin, ethereal
                          matter is shaped and this is what we call the aura, which is not yet visible to most people.

                  fountain of light. I thought "<em>My friend looks so bright</em>". I was very tired from the intense
                  concentration and "came out" of that vibration.<br>
                  During recent years, the Masters have come from the spiritual world and literally shown me the
                  greatness that is in front of my eyes without my knowing it. Nobody's life can be the same after they
                  have encountered this greatness.</p>
