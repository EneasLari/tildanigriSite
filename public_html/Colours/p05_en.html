            <p align="justify">It is the next day, once again  on the same veranda, in the afternoon. I strongly wish to see my aura. I begin  to concentrate on the open palm of my right hand. A transparent "lace" starts  to shape around my fingers. After a while, I can see the colour blue, light  blue.<br>

          <td colspan="2" class="txt"><p align="justify">Later  on, while I was reading <a href="../Newton/p07_t_en.htm#la_03" class="la">Michael Newton's book "The Journey of Souls"</a>, I  realised that as far as my energy frequency is concerned, I belong to a small  percentage of incarnated souls. I keep this information, in order to check its  validity every now and then in the future.<br>
          </p>
            <p align="justify">However,  my query as to why I have such a big difference in my perception of the world and the  attitude of my life from the majority of the people is somehow answered ...  During such moments arrogance lurks in order to destroy the journey of  development. I will fall  victim many times over in the future, as each  soul that is in a hurry to grow before its due time does, particularly when the  "end" of incarnations on the earth begins to gleam and the fatigue of the  soul accumulated has been great...<br>
              <br>
              My  memory begins to come back, recalling all those senses that I once had for  other lives which I had lived in other places on Earth. What activated my  memory was first of all specific persons, but also smells, senses, atmospheres and negative and positive emotions.</p>
             Just as in a lifetime, when you have several years of experience on a subject, you accumulate knowledge and you acquire freedom and  ease in the particular job or subject. This is how it goes with the total of  lifetimes. Living many lives on Earth, we accumulate  knowledge for life  itself, until sometime when we acquire real freedom and ease internally and  then happiness is permanently within us. But until this is done, we pass  through the difficult pathway of self-knowledge, the first step of which is   seeing precisely who we really are, without beautifications. A laborious  process, with a lot of frustrations, many setbacks and further developments, until  we become light, that is to say, until we overcome fear and insecurity.
            <div align="justify">
            <p>I begin  to experience that paradise exists on Earth, when it exists inside my self,  irrelevant of the external environment. </p>
