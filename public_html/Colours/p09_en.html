          <td class="txt"><p align="justify">This is  the light my friend radiates, as I see it around her, without her doing  anything! It's as simple as that. The colours are spotless and the bands absolutely  distinguishable from one another. I see  the purple-mauve and the electric blue light very intensely. Up till now (12 October 2001), I have seen their highest intensity when I am in  the countryside. Lately I see them intensely in Athens also. Now that I am writing (20 November 2001), the light is very intense both here and everywhere.  The aura bands are visible at night too, even around the electric bulbs that are  on, apart from their own light. I also see the aura round the shadows of people  and things.<br>

            <p>As  pictured in the sketch, the two first bands of light radiate very clean and  intense colours. The first band has a dark blue-mauve colour and the second an  electric blue, both spotless and luminous. The next band is much broader,  fourfold, than the previous one, and carries platinum light. The band that  follows is a deep ruby red, the next one is orange, the one following is  yellow, and the last one radiates the green colour of fresh grass. All the colours  are clear, lucent and natural and they are completely transparent; therefore I can  see through them.</p>
            <p>The   colours present a person in reverse order; if we take into  consideration that their regular order is that of a person's energy centres,  beginning from the first one in the coccyx that emits red colour and moving  upwards with the following sequence they emit orange, yellow, green, blue or  light blue, violet or pink and mauve. The aura colours of my friend appear in  that sequence, because her soul is in absolute balance. The exterior colour of  her aura is green. My friend  consciously chooses to follow her heart and  therefore she mainly functions with the fourth energy centre, the light of  which is a green colour.<br>

So that's where the true idea of playing cards originates,  and this is its real meaning.</p>
