            <p align="justify">I  am observing my friend at some point while she is concentrating. I know that  she feels deeply and absolutely sincere about what she is doing.</p>
            <p align="justify">I  am watching her forehead, in between her eyes, faintly vibrating. The area in  front of her head reminds me of a bright blue cloud. As far as my eyes can see,  without losing my own concentration, the whole place is filled with a blue and  platinum light. Near her face the light is more intense.</p>
            <p align="justify">Behind  her head, what is drawn with yellow would be described as a pellucid cloud of  white and gold mixed together, which glows much more vividly than material gold.</p>
            <p align="justify">I  take off my  glasses which I wear for myopia. I see the aura myopically distorted. I put them on again and  see it clearly. An image is forming in my brain, which means  that the light is passing through my eyes and is being transferred by the optic  nerve to the brain. This light is the Light and it is perceptible by the third  eye, which means my sixth energy centre together with my own two eyes.</p>
            <div align="justify">In Joseph Ostrom's  book  called "You and your Aura" he refers to the 7 million cone cells and the 130  million rods  which are the cells that enable the human eye to see. The cone cells are for focusing in daylight and the  rods are  sensitised when  daylight fades, and enable us to see in the dark. "The rods" Ostrom writes,  "are the receivers of our peripheral sight. Under conditions of low light, the  rods are covered with a substance called
            <a href="p35_en.html#la_02" class="la">rhodopsin, known as visual purple</a>. The visual purple, which in reality is a dark red colour, is very sensitive to   light and it turns white as soon as light falls on the recipient. As the  intensity of the light gets weaker, the rhodopsin is reassembled. With this  peripheral sight and under conditions of low lighting the rods capture the  aura."            </div></td>
