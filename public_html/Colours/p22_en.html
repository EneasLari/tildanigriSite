            <p align="justify">It's  September 2001 and we're on the beach. The whole beach around each outline has  the two aura layers I've seen around my friend: dark blue-mauve and  electric-blue. Has she covered the whole beach with her aura? Indeed she has. I  always re-examine what I see many times, to make sure.</p>
            <p align="justify">While  she is about to come out of the sea, an unknown girl of about 6 years old  approaches her, starts playing with her while tumbling about in the water. At some  point the girl tells her <em>"You know me,  you've seen me before."</em> My friend answers logically, "<em>Where do</em> <em>I know you from  sweetheart?"</em> The girl starts splashing sea water all over her and repeats  once again "<em>You know me, you've seen me  before."</em> I observe the young girl's aura: it's blue, bright, big and clear.  I then feel within me that the light of my friend was the reason for the girl  to recall within her the memory of the spiritual world, the fellow souls, the  Masters. And because children do not prevent the expression of their  subconscious with their minds, the young girl expressed the product of her soul  completely freely.</p>
            <p align="justify">Afterwards  she came and sat next to us with the confidence of those people who belong to  the same soul family. We discussed things and played for a while and everybody felt familiar, as  if we had already known each other for a very long time. The words of the child and  her whole behaviour showed adult maturity, and at the same time she was a  little girl playing and enjoying life. While leaving together from the sea, the  little girl showed us the age of her soul once again: addressing a group of  adults who were making too much noise without thinking of the people around  them, she told them with rigorous tenderness, "<em>Don't shout</em>" reminding them the respect for  others.</p>
            <p align="justify">Every time  people  from the same soul family, come together, no matter how different our  characters might be, the intimacy we feel between us and the common basis that  we have on moral issues is strong. We feel this within. If we see the aura too,  we ascertain with our own eyes that we vibrate in the same frequency, that is  to say our light is of similar colour.</p></td>
