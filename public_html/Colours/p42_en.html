                  1 June 2002. I am sure that the wave of light is directly linked to the pulsation of someone's heart.
                  It is directly linked to everything, but especially to the human heart and therefore has therapeutic
                  properties. Light cures everything. </p>

                <p>Goethe reminds us of the most difficult thing. By living, it's revealed to all of us how difficult it
                  is to move on by following what's easiest, that which is before our very eyes, the greatness that has
                  been revealed to us. We live, however, and know that by connecting with the Light we heal everything.
                  This "connecting with the Light" is the great Art, the Art of Life.</p>

                  <p>Five years later I'm with a friend, who practices acupuncture. I observe acupuncture. Initially,
                    and after she has inserted the needles into various parts of the body of the person who is having
                    acupuncture done, I see all the energy emerging. Then, in a black background I see red spheres with
                    thin outlines continuously and intensively vibrating. This lasts for some time. Finally I see all
                    the colours of the aura appearing in their utmost clarity, the clearest I have seen so far. The
                    energy is at its greatest rekindling and the field is regenerated. I understood that acupuncture
                    clears and regenerates the aura, resulting in the regeneration of someone's material body as well.
