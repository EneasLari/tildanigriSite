            <p align="justify">It's morning on the  veranda. The handrail, the rails and the edge of the roof, have from one side   blue and violet light and from the other an excellent ruby red and yellow. I  feel that it is the aura of the Sun covering everything.</p>
            <p align="justify">I clearly see   everything there is in the three dimensional space behind the aura streaks,  because the streaks are completely transparent. I think of the stained  glass windows in churches, the precious stones and  visible laser beams. The aura I see  is more beautiful than all this, without comparison. At a certain place in the  house where we live, there is a precious stone called an opal. I take it as a sign. Opal  appears in tints of the rainbow. I'm thinking that  by looking at   precious stones, people subconsciously remember the field of Love they left as souls,  the aura that they could see. They named them precious stones, because they  reminded them of the Precious Existence.</p>
            <p align="justify">From the veranda I  see innumerable rainbows up in the sky. I see the detailing of solar rays in  their spectrum,  so-called by the science of optics, the Sun spectrum.</p>
            <p align="justify">All our knowledge  is in bits and pieces. We need to put it together in order to  truly see.</p>
            <div align="justify">We live inside the light and we don't understand it. It seems to me that this light that I'm seeing now is the  Body of the Lord and all of the advanced Beings existing in Him. That's exactly  what we mean when we say that we live inside His body. It's literal! When  someone sees the light, the aura, there's no need to go to a specific place to  worship Him. His soul opens wherever he is at every single moment and the Energy of  the Light of our Lord enters him. Then he feels complete.</div></td>
