                        <p>It's summer 2003. While walking on Mount Pelion, the truth struck me on the real existence of
                          Unicorns and Centaurs. Greek mythology says that the Unicorn was a mythical animal which
                          appeared on Mount Pelion in the form of a horse with an acute horn in between the eyebrows. As
                          for the Centaurs their story is well-known, especially that of Centaur Chiron, who was wise, a
                          teacher of many personalities of that era and a healer.</p>
                        <p>So, as I was breathing the clean air in the forest of the ancient mountain, from within
                          emerged the knowledge that the Centaurs and the Unicorns were the Doctors of that era. The
                          Unicorn was a healer-assistant of the Centaurs. The Centaurs were energy healers and took
                          their name from the Greek words "kento" (I do needlework or I do fancy work) and "avra"
                          (aura), which metaphorically mean "healing the aura". They were depicted that way - as both
                          people and horses together - because the conscience of the people at that time, perceived them
                          as strong as horses, with supernatural powers.</p>
                        The Unicorns transferred energy from the sixth energy centre, the one we call the third eye. The
                        horn they carry in the centre of their forehead is the crystallisation of the energy they
                        transferred in order to heal. When energy emanates from the third eye, it is directed straight
                        on, swirling at the same time, like a concentrated laser, to wherever there is a need for
                        healing, stimulation, balance or support. Hence, it is illustrated with a swirling horn.
                        Besides, the whole world, the thicker matter, is the condensation of thin matter, namely
                        invisible energy, invisible only to human eyes.
