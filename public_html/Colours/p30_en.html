          <td class="txt"><p align="justify">January 2002. I see the aura around my hand. The  electric blue is there, as I saw it before, but a band of light violet colour  has been formed faintly, not as intense as the blue one. Five months after I  had first seen my aura, I observe a difference. I also see it in my house. All  surfaces are covered with these aura colours. The shadow of my hand, just as  all the shadows, including the ones of all the objects, has my aura around  them.<br>

            <p align="justify">Because I have seen people with mauve vibration, yet  who still have problems to resolve, the same as myself, I understand with much pain  and trouble that one life in this frequency may not be enough,  until I can vibrate continuously and safely in the Light. The will of my  soul shall show this in the future.</p></td>

            <p>I know that the repetition of the experiences I'm  going through and the full understanding of the "lessons" arising from them  will bring me  the desired result. But my soul is comfortable in what it  already knows and is afraid of anything new, although it has already opened to  the Light. On each occasion when  I think I have managed to accomplish something,   without it having become  second nature to me yet however, I've been  brought to a halt  within, and then the ego comes forth once more. I must try again.</p>
