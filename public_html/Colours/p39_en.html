                <p align="justify">21 April 2002. With some friends we visit our blind, old friend, Mrs &quot;R&quot;.
                  Her body suffers. Her high blood pressure worries her. The friend places her hands on top of Mrs R's
                  head (on the 7th energy centre) and concentrates. I observe a black cloud covering her hands and then
                  disappearing. Soon, the space around them is filled with mauve energy. Black doesn't exist anymore.
                  The process is completed in five minutes.</p>
                <p align="justify">The effect is immediate. Right afterwards Mrs R's blood pressure from a very high
                  reading which the pressure gauge had showed before the transfer of energy, is now measured again with
                  the same gauge and it has dropped to a perfectly normal pressure. </p>
                <p align="justify">I have the feeling that the black I see in the beginning, emerging from Mrs R and
                  then evaporating, is her fear, the sadness from her loneliness. Through our friend, the Lord took away
                  every fear and grief, literally. I understood that the energy of the mauve frequency was the one that
                  helped Mrs R <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">His
                    words "your Faith has saved you", is literal.</a> Mrs R has repeated many times to our friend
                  "<em>how wonderful it feels when you put your hands on me</em>". So, this time, right after our friend
                  suggested it, the old woman accepted it right away and let herself go with absolute confidence.<br>

                <p align="justify">I realised that healing in reality is self-healing and that it is achieved, as meant
                  by the word itself, always starting from ourselves.</p>
                <p align="justify">Five years later I found myself in a very painful situation. I had severe pains in my
                  left shoulder and I couldn't move my arm at all. I had stopped using it, so I could neither drive, nor
                  work, nor sleep due to the pain. Two days passed without any medication, hoping that it would get
                  better with the help of a thermo-cream. The result was that my arm was on the verge of becoming
                  totally stiff. I feared I had to go to the doctor and get some strong medication to treat a long-term
                  situation. </p>
                <p align="justify">On the third day, after work, I had an appointment with my friend. She asked me
                  whether I wanted her to transfer energy to my aching shoulder. "<em>You shouldn't ask. Of course I
                    do</em>", I replied. She puts her hands over my shoulder and we concentrate. I start feeling as if I
                  were under anaesthesia. I coughed as I had done once before after I had just had surgery, recovering
                  from the anaesthesia, when I coughed due to the anaesthetic. So, I felt as if I had taken light
                  anaesthesia. About five minutes passed. I slowly began to lie down. After a while I made the first
                  attempt to move my arm. It moved as if it were "waking" from stiffness. At the same time, the pain
                  stopped instantly and I could make almost any movement. The next day, the arm functioned normally,
                  without feeling anything of what had proceeded. </p>

                <p align="justify">What I had experienced was really impressive. By now I knew through my own body that
                  the shrinking of the earthly time up to the point of automation resulting in what we call a <a
                    href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv2','visible')">miracle,</a> was
                  possible. During the transfusion of the energy, I didn't know what was happening, but I had absolute
                  faith in positive results only. I know that this faith brought them.</p>
                <p align="justify">I had seen with my own eyes the high blood pressure of an old woman drop immediately.
                  Now, I was experiencing in my own body the absolute relief of pain and the return to normal movement
                  of a limb, whose operational capacity had been affected. Further on, <a href="p52_en.html"
                    class="la">I mention how a friend was healed</a> from her severe skin infection. I consider them to
                  be three different medical cases: high blood pressure, functional disability and a skin infection. I'm
                  thinking that the potential of the energy is infinite and that it can really do wonders when there is
                  inner strength and faith.</p>
