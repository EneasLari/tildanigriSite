            <p align="justify">I see a friend's, N's aura. It is yellow with traces of  green, which look like small bristles of a brush. The yellow of his aura is very dirty  and dim and I know that this is due to the ever so many fears he has in  life. The electric-blue light I see as a second band is the blue light  appearing in the auras of everyone who long for and follow the change of the  Age of Aquarius.</p>
            <p align="justify">We sit altogether and drink coffee. My friend and N.,   are sitting side by side and talking. I sit opposite them and  observe them. I gradually see, as it usually happens, their figures getting  darker like shadows and mauve-blue spheres coming out of my friend's forehead,  as shown in the drawings below, and they rest in our friend's aura, on and  around his head. The process is completed in a fraction of a second. To check  that I indeed see correctly, I blink. I see the spheres constantly gathering in  N.'s aura around his material body, as shown in the sketch on the <span class="style1">bottom right hand side </span>.</p>
            <p align="justify">The room is filled with mauve-blue spheres. The next  day, our friend says, "What a wonderful feeling our company left me with  yesterday!" I am thinking that I literally saw this "wonderful" feeling of his.  It was the mauve-blue spheres, which he slowly absorbed and it appears that  their effect lasts for several hours.</p>
            <p align="justify">I'm reading in the book, "The power of Thought" by  Master Morya that "if a thought is directed with special clarity to a specific  person, no doubt it will touch his aura." I had just seen the actual <u><a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">touch  of the aura by clear thoughts</a></u>.</p>
            <div align="justify">In the future I witnessed  the transformation of this man and his victory over his fear. N. is certainly  an example of a man, whose faith literally saved him from the evils that were  nesting in his soul. I also understood that  clear and bright thoughts are  never lost; on the contrary, there comes a time when they are implemented in the  material world.</div></td>
