            <p>I was looking at  the sun, facing it as it rose  from behind my house. What is painted circularly in this  illustration of the book, I saw exactly around the sun, only the light was  alive. In the position, of what looks like an eye in Leadbeater's image, I see  the sun. I feel that I see its aura. I see circular beams, such as the ones  displayed at the side, concerning the third energy centre. The more I look at  the Sun's aura the more optimistic I feel, as if experiencing this feeling for  the first time.</p>
            <p>During those days a  book by <a href="../afos/Carl Jung/cover_en.htm" class="la">Carl Jung</a> came into my hands, which contained mantalas painted  by Jung  himself. What I see reminds me very much of them. These forms are archetypical  and depict the soul, or the collective Unconscious, as Jung says.<br>
              <br>
              Mantalas are the  illustrated imprints of the energy spin.</p>
