            <p align="justify">It's the night of December 2001. We're at my friend's office and she is translating <a href="../Newton/cover_en.htm" class="la">Michael Newton's book, &quot;Journey of Souls</a>&quot;. On the  windows of the room I see absolutely geometric and perfectly clear bands of light, of the  colours mauve, green and then mauve and then green again, up to the roof, where a  yellow band appears. The room is full of these bands of light, of dimensions  and proportions - in relation to the room - just as they are painted here. I  get the idea that the glass helps me see the aura more easily, which will be  proven as  fact many times in the future. I am thinking of the many more  wonderful images of the spiritual frequency that we cannot see...</p>            
            <p align="justify">The colour mauve is the energy frequency where higher  spirituality vibrates. The colour green  is the frequency where love vibrates  and the colour yellow where  thought vibrates. Let's see the analogy with the invisible  world: the colour mauve  effectuates the energy frequency of our aura and  the aura of the book which is highly spiritual, the green colour   effectuates pure love and selflessness with which we are translating this book and  finally, the colour yellow represents the energy of intellectual thought that we  give during the translation.</p>
            <p align="justify">Nowhere in the world is there anything strange. The  natural and what we call supernatural world is one and the same thing. Everything is  natural; since I can see it, that is to say it's normally formed in my brain with an image  via the optic nerve and ceases to belong to the realm of the supernatural; I've  made it natural, by seeing it.</p>
            <p align="justify">Even if only one person sees something, then it is natural.</p></td>
