            <p align="justify">21 May 2002, the day we celebrate the names of Constantine and Helen in Greece.  The choir of a Conservatory presents a programme of songs on the passion of  Christ. The singers, the pianist and the choir with the director have just  taken their places on stage. They start singing. Next to each one of them I see  a form of light. It is their guides. We are never alone. The image of these  people with their guides fills me with optimism and the confidence that  everything is and will work out fine. The anxiety, the stage fright of the  artists before the show, is absorbed by the luminous entities that with  rock-steady stability stand next to each one of them and give the charge-power, the  energy needed to cope in a performance. The anxiety prevents the energy from flowing  in order to perform, so the guides set it right by encouraging them. Whoever is  fully connected to his Self, part of which is his guide, reaches the perfect performance.</p>
            <p align="justify">I wonder how I am so sure that these are the guides and not the ethereal  bodies of the artists. <br>
              <a href="p10_en.html" class="la">I have already described</a> the ethereal bodies of  people. The characteristic of  ethereal bodies is that they come and go from  the material body and don't stand firmly next to it, as guides do. The other  difference is that the bodies of the guides are very bright and appear with a  yellowish light, as they're painted, while the ethereal bodies of most people  look like a grey cloud. In some others, who have pure souls, their ethereal body  is as clear as the light of the masters' body. In this case also, the  difference is that the ethereal enters the material body, or doesn't take leave  of it completely, or rarely does so. We could say that it inhabits the material  body with pleasure, because it is fed from all those positive qualities that  bring on the Light.</p>
            <div align="justify">Each moment, in whatever  effort someone makes, his guide, the Light, stands beside him and gives him  the strength to carry through his task. I'm thinking of the actors in the  theatre. Their guide is always by their side. Even more so in more extreme  situations, such as a surgery, on which the survival of our material body  depends.<br>
