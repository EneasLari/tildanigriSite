            <p align="justify">In the room we rented  for the holidays, all the furniture and objects have my friend's aura, except  for the cushions where it's different. It strikes me that my friend's pillow  has a purple-mauve aura, while mine has a light blue one. Of course this  happens because the top three centres of energy are on our head and therefore  the energy identity of every person is projected more strongly.</p>
            <p align="justify">Every person has  his or her own light in the world, which they leave in the invisible field as well. A  clairvoyant can see, no matter how many years may pass, the aura of the people  who passed from a place. The purple aura, which is the strongest of all,  prevails in the room. In Physics we learn that purple light is the higher colour  of the spectrum and has the shortest wavelength, which means that it's faster  than all the other colours. Hence the purple aura prevails over the other  vibrations and covers everything faster. That's how the Masters hyper-cover us with their  energy; we can even sense them, provided we leave all our  channels open. This is how we exist, all people and animals, all the material  and immaterial beings inside the Body of the omnipresent and all  fulfilling Being. </p>
            <p align="justify">After some time,  having returned to Athens, I got the idea to look at the dominant colour of the Masters' aura  through their texts, or any illustrations at our disposal, sculptures, or any  work in general that they have left behind. Therefore, I made a list of some of  the great Masters: Hercules, Aeolus, <a href="../afos/Pythagoras/index_en.htm" class="la">Pythagoras</a>, Democritus, Socrates,  <a href="../afos/Plato/index_en.htm" class="la">Plato</a>, <a href="../afos/Apollonios/index_en.htm" class="la">Apollonius of Tyana</a>, <a href="../afos/Lobsang Rampa/index_en.htm" class="la">Lobsang Rampa</a>, Buddha, Illarion, Kout  Humi Lal Singh, Omraam Mikhael <a href="../afos/Aivanhov/index_en.htm" class="la">Aivanhov</a>, Earl of St. Germaine, Morya, <a href="../afos/Khalil Gibran/index_en.htm" class="la">Kahlil  Gibran</a>, <a href="../afos/Gavrilia/index_en.htm" class="la">Mother Gavrilia</a>, Blavatsky, Leadbeater, Besant, Elifas Levi,  da Vinci, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Kazantzakis, <a href="../afos/Kavafis/index_en.htm" class="la">Constantine P. Cavafy</a>, <a href="../afos/Edgar Cayce/index_en.htm" class="la">Edgar  Cayce</a>, <a href="../afos/Carl Jung/cover_en.htm" class="la">Carl Jung</a>, <a href="../afos/Scott Peck/index_en.htm" class="la">Scott Peck</a>, Gandhi, Michael Newton, <a href="../afos/Hawking/index_en.htm" class="la">Stephen  Hawking</a>. I included Jesus in the list as well.</p>
            <p align="justify">To check and  recheck the colours of each one's aura, I painted the hue of the mauve I saw next  to each name. Afterwards I hid this list and repainted a fresh list every time  I felt I could see very clearly. Actually, I let an even longer time lapse in  between the lists I painted. Comparing the lists after a long time, I realised  that I had painted exactly the same hue for every Master in all of them.  Another interesting finding was that each Master had a different hue of  mauve. Those who worked with a lot of people had a lighter hue than  those who created without mixing with  many; as if it were a palette with  all the hues of  mauve. I also knew that during these dark times, many  unknown Masters are on Earth to help people. Each one's different hue is due to  the different abilities that each one brings, in order to place his own stone  to  God's Work, covering different needs, all essential to this enormous  puzzle. Every little piece of the Plan is equally important. <br>
                <br>
              Finally, with my heart wide open, I found out that the only colour that  differed from  all the others' was that of Jesus: it was the only one  that contained all the colours of the spectrum and all their hues that exist in  the world. What ultimately emerged from Him was a silver colour, nothing like  it on earth. Through a fan that opened very widely, spinning constantly, the  colour of the Lord spread out in front of my wonder-stricken eyes...<br>
