                <p>Saturday, 10   March 2007. We are at my  friend's home with her brother. The three of us are having a discussion and my  friend remembers how their father, who passed away many years ago, put them to  bed when they were children and said goodnight in his own humorous and sweet  way, which was acting out a pantomime to them.</p>
                <p>My friend's father bore a very advanced soul,  vibrating in a mauve colour,  which I could see  in his photos. The moment  we mentioned his name, the air conditioner on the  opposite wall, switched on, worked  for a few seconds and switched back off.</p>
                <p>The way it  operated wasn't normal. It reminded us of the  sound made by the old steam engines when they have stopped at the railway  station. A second later its flaps reopened by themselves and it started working  again. Then, it "sighed" and stopped immediately after. The air conditioner was not  on. Nobody had touched the machine nor its remote control. The timer was not  on. We all knew  at the same time within ourselves that this was a greeting from their  father's soul and light. From the first instant we know within ourselves whether  something is true or not. The air conditioner had never operated in this way in the  past nor in the future did this or anything similar ever happened again. The  "message" was clear.</p>
                <p>The room was full of a mauve and green light with the  diagonal pattern that we came across in <u><a href="p58_en.html" class="la">chapter 58</a></u>. The love my friend  had for him brought "him" close. He "greeted" us in a very intense way,  declaring his love and presence to us.</p>
                <p>Love unites the two worlds, the physical and the one that comes after or  more correctly, the one running side by side with the natural one, i.e. the  spiritual world. Everything exists simultaneously, but most of it escapes our  attention. Besides, we all know it within ourselves that love unites and creates,  while its absence causes desolation, hurts and destroys.<br>
