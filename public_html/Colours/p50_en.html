                <p>I want to know who my Guide is. I ask inwardly "<em>what's your name</em>" and she answers, "<em>Iris</em>". As I always check and recheck every such experience and I  first say to myself, "<em>No way, it must be  my mind answering me in my imagination</em>", I ask again at a random  moment, when there is no emotional pressure. In this case, no matter how many times as I  ask, the answer is always "Iris". However, one day  the answer started coming  from the external world. Once, while I was asking myself, an excursion coach  passed with the label <em>Iris</em> on it. The  next day, while I was wondering again, I saw  a bottle of water with  the name <em>Iris </em>on it in front of me. Every time I  think of this issue or I have a question or a problem to solve, Iris appears in  front of me in one way or another and I know that she's with me. It's the Iris of  the Eye that allows me to see the aura. It's Iris - Jesus, depicted by the  Renaissance artist Raphael in his famous painting entitled "<em>The dispute at the Eucharist"</em>.</p>
                <p>I read in ancient Greek mythology that the goddess Iris, the goddess with  the name of the "Rainbow", was a Messenger (deriving from the word  Angelos=Angel in ancient Greek, meaning the One who carries the news or the  Angel). Hesiod, the ancient Greek poet, in his work "<em>Theogony</em>"  (:on the origins of men and Gods) mentions in verses 780-787 that when gods quarrel among themselves, Zeus sends  the goddess Iris to restore the divine order to all those gods and goddesses who  have lost their way and have been isolated because of their anger. All of us  were once gods in the sense that we were united with our higher Self. My Guide  Iris comes to remind me of the existence of the spiritual world and my place in  it. Even when I lose my faith and feel alone, viewing the aura reconnects me  with the Light and my higher Self. Then I become complete and happy again.</p>
                <p>The manifestation of my Guide, which I realised so clearly for the first  time, happened in the beginning of the '90s. I was walking with a friend of mine  on the pavement of an avenue in Athens. In front of us there was a very old car, whose battery was being  charged by someone, with cables connected to the battery of another car. At  that moment I was warned internally by a female voice that the car was going to  start by itself, without a driver, and that I should stop walking immediately.  I didn't realise this warning consciously; I just received it in a flash. Only  after the incident, while I was processing the internal and external events, I  realised the ever so clear warning. Now I understand how many times we receive  - without knowing it - the hyper-coverage of our Guides ... what we simply call ... &quot;we had a guardian angel&quot; .</p>
                <p>Then, again in fractions of a second and internally, because there  wasn't much time to warn him orally, I "said" to my friend "<em>Stop</em>" and he froze exactly where he was.  The telepathic communication had saved us.</p>
                <p>Without anyone behind the wheel, the car started, crossed the flow of traffic coming down Alexandra's  avenue, went over the central reservation at top speed and hit the door of a completely astonished car driver who, fortunately,  wasn't hurt. It seems that more than one internal force worked at that time towards the  happy ending. The incident left everyone open-mouthed and even more so me and  my friend. Especially afterwards, when we immediately went for coffee and  discussed the internal facts. My friend told me that something made him freeze;  obviously his Guide and perhaps together with my backing.</p>
                <p>Even if <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">a Guide has "no sex"</a>, because it's an immaterial being,  it appears to us in a specific form, because we see him or her as she/he was  incarnated from some other life in which we had lived together. I "see" this specific  Guide in me as the form of a peaceful woman, standing in front of a fireplace  with one hand resting on its mantelpiece, talking to me very sweetly. She's  dressed in clothes of the 30's and the fireplace, where she stands, is of an art deco style. I feel that it's a scene from that previous life we had lived  together. As it seems, we were incarnated here on Earth in the decade of the  '30s as well. Her presence calms me and gives me confidence. Her revelation in  me overwhelmed me and for years later I brought this incident into my mind. I  realised that my faith in the existence of this world had already been  established.</p>
                <p>Iris, thank you for always being next to me on such occasions. This  relationship is proportional and we could say the continuation of a real love  affair, where each partner continually reinforces and assists the other in a perpetual  unification movement.</p>
                Lets assume that all this  doesn't exist; we can't do anything else but accept the fact that also in this  life, there is a person we deeply loved and who loved us back, who was always there for  us, listened to the depth of our soul, is our guide anyway; we consult him or her,  think of him or her in our troubles, yearn to see and hear him or her. My longing for  my Guide is the same. Only if we feel that way for someone in our physical  life, can we understand what is happening in the ethereal one and then  we shall  join internally the "before" and the "after death", as a single, continuous  internal life. The inner life is immaterial anyway, like our emotions, which   manifest only through their results. My internal life manifests its  existence through my very actions.<br>
