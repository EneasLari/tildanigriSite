            <p align="justify">Later  on the same day. After being emotional, my rational side took over. We went outside  the specific window only to realise that if that figure was human, he should be  at least 2.50 meters tall, to be able to look  through that window. There was no ladder outside he could have used. We sit on  the veranda again. The emotion returns together with the aroma of incense. With  the corner of our eye we see a figure moving around outside at the back of the house and  I see it from the windows literally flying a few centimetres above the ground,  crossing the house from one end to the other. So, I experienced with my own  eyes what people paint and write about spirits. The emotion returns even deeper.</p>
            <div align="justify">
              <p>The next day the Universe tries us. At the same place where we had seen "the  flying figure", there's a young couple standing, trying to unlock the door of  the apartment next to ours. They have just arrived for holidays. We wonder  whether we had seen one of them the previous day and didn't realise it. The  earthly doubt of the mind gives way to faith: we know within that the figure we  saw was a Being from the spiritual world, which indeed had come to salute us.  The Universe often tries our judgement and our ability to distinguish what is  spiritual and what isn't.</p>
