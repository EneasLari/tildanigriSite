                <p>January 2002. My friend is concentrating on a particular person and is sending him energy. I see
                  these half circles moving away from the front of her face in the formation shown in the sketch.
                  They're "flying" in a geometric formation, at equal distances. It reminds me of the flights of birds.
                  They're moving diagonally through the room and then disappear. Soon after, a new "flight" appears
                  again, following the same route. As long as my concentration lasts, this continues.</p>
                <p>The colour of the half circles is very dark mauve and has a blue outline. I notice that the colours
                  of these forms are similar to the two dominant colours of my friend's aura, which I had seen
                  originally. It seems that this happens when someone sends energy.<br>

                          <p> The forms were in some cases unseen by the transmitter, but in all cases were perceived by
                            the recipient, who immediately sent rough sketches of what was seen by the next post to the
                            transmitter, who has kindly supplied the following notes regarding them: (...) In the
                            coloured drawings enclosed the blue forms appeared to represent the more devotional element
                            of the thought.</p>

                            The yellow forms accompanied the endeavour to communicate intellectual fortitude, or mental
                            strength and courage. The rosy pink appeared when the thought was blended with affectionate
                            sympathy. (...) In this way many details can be checked and compared looking from opposing
                            perspectives while the nature of the effect in communication offers yet another
                            confirmation... </p>
                          <p>These few drawings give but a slight idea of the varied flower-like and geometric forms
                            seen, but neither paint nor crayon seems capable of representing the glowing beauty of their
                            living colours.&quot;<br>
                          </p>I continue observing the aura and the confirmation of what I see.<br>
