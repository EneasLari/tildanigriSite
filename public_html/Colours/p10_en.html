            <p align="justify">We are  on a beach. A very cheerful group of tourists is in front of us. They are  playing and having fun. Each person has his contour next to him that is full,   white and vibrating. And the same goes for all the objects. It is like seeing two worlds at the same time. In between them there are many  rainbows as well as a big one, which evoke the sense of celebration and joy. As a matter of fact I realise  that  I am indeed seeing the two worlds simultaneously. What a  blessing!</p>
            <p align="justify">In  Joseph Ostrom's book "<em>You and Your Aura</em>"  (1987) I read that what I see is called ethereal body. Indeed he reports that in  the old days they called it a ghost, a spirit, a fairy. Oh, the so-called, well known  ghost ... Well, it is not that frightful. On the contrary, it is a game. The  first band of the tourists' aura is white. Later on I read in <a href="../Newton/p07_t_en.htm#la_08" class="la">Michael  Newton's book "<em>Journey of Souls</em></a>"  that white colour is emitted by the souls that are in the initial stages of  development.</p>
            <p align="justify">The  ethereal bodies of the tourists that I observe are white also. I am thinking  that this is the reason the belief that ghosts are all white has prevailed; because  they are souls at initial stages of development. And that is why they are  attached to the Earth after their disincarnation.</p>
            <p align="justify">I  record every single thing I see concerning the aura. I never cease to be  sceptical at the same time. Besides, scepticism is included in my studies, in  the way I and everybody else in the West were raised. But what exactly should I  doubt? Everything I witness with my own eyes? This would mean doubting my own  self. In any case, I am examining everything I see. Most impressive is that  everything I see is not only recorded in books, but these books came into my  hands after I had already seen the aura and had experimented with it, watching  different people under different circumstances.</p>
            <div align="justify">From now on I know that  seeing the aura means my entry into the invisible world. Each viewing of the  aura is accompanied by a sense of lasting euphoria, joy, celebration and Love. I  do not need any explanation. I am happy!<br>
