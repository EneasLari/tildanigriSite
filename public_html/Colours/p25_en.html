          <td class="txt"><p align="justify">This is  the portrait of a friend as I see him after August 2001. The first aura band is  dark indigo blue, which means that it contains dark blue with red. This blue is  called  Indian blue or Egyptian blue and is known as indigo blue. The term  "indigo children" came about from the sight of their aura, which is of this  colour. My friend is also an indigo "child".</p>
            <p align="justify">Indigo  blue and in general the colour mauve consists of blue and red. The blue light  is the vibration of our fifth energy centre and as the Master says, "the chakra  that emits and receives actions of intellectual essence".<br>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="2" class="txt"><p align="justify">Observing  the energy structure of people, I confirm this truth. Red is the light with  which our first energy centre vibrates, "links us with our earthly existence,  and through it we receive the earthly vibrations". The mauve aura, therefore,  indicates a spiritual person who has inside himself united  the earthly with the  divine self.</p>
            <p align="justify">This is  the light of our seventh energy centre, on the top of our head. This centre  "links us with our divine being and through it we receive the universal  vibrations and unify with our higher self" an experience which I begin to have  in this life and I detect how difficult it is to open myself completely to the  Light. </p>            </td>
