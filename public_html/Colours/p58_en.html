                <p>It's the spring of 2007. I am home alone, resting.  Suddenly the room is filled with green and mauve light. It is so intense that  all the objects around me "disappear" and I am completely inside this Light.  Later that day, when I spoke to my friend, she told me that at the same time I  saw this Light, she was transferring energy. That same coincidence was repeated  many times afterwards. On another day, when I saw my house  filled with  the same bright Light, she told me that she was praying at that particular  time.</p>
                <p>The aura of my friend has two dominant colours, green  and mauve, which always fill the space around her. I see it whenever we meet  and also without her physical presence. The green light, which is the colour of  unconditional love, shows that the friend first uses the fourth chakra, because  this serves the purpose of giving which she has undertaken in this particular  incarnation. She is distinguished by the infinite, eternal and unchanging love  for everyone and everything. Therefore, the green light she bears is very  strong and crystal clear. However, the dominant colour of her aura is mauve,  the colour of insight and ability to abolish the restrictive dimensions of the  Earth, namely matter, space and time and even the colour of expanding the  ability to receive and send energy of the finer vibrations.</p>
                <p>Every person reveals his absolute personal vibrating  pattern in his aura. His energy field consists of a set of geometric and other  patterns and forms, which might be vibrating from chaos and disorder to  absolute harmony and balance. I see this perfectly diagonal pattern in my  friend's aura.</p>
                Whenever I am inside  this light, space and time disappear and I feel perfectly happy and complete.  Often, it's enough to connect through our thoughts with people that make us  serene and enrich us so as to "inhabit" in this way their aura and enjoy the  feeling of unity.<br>
