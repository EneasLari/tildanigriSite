          <td width="48%" class="txt"><p align="justify">I returned to Athens. It was the  evening of 23 February 2002 when I went back home after work. By chance I started watching a  documentary on  TV about the geometric field shapes appearing in  England.</p>          
            <p align="justify">Among other things,  the documentary showed a video shot by an amateur filmmaker.<br>

          <td colspan="2" class="txt"><p align="justify">One night he   recorded with his video camera two golden spherules when, in front of  human  eyes  within a minute, they made rapid cyclical movements over the  fields and formed one of the most well-known field shapes in England.</p>          
            <p align="justify">The <a href="p20_en.html" class="la">two golden  spherules</a> shown in the documentary were the same as the ones I saw coming  out of my friend's forehead and the one pictured in the book, "Thought-Forms", by  Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater. The next day this very video was shown at a  central news programme, only to be completely ignored immediately afterwards.  Nobody asked why artists would make these shapes of extraordinary precision  anonymously in one night, without announcing such an achievement, because it is  indeed an achievement to be able to make something so unique on the planet overnight.</p>
            <p align="justify">Naturally, when  someone's soul isn't ready to accept the truth, they don't believe what happens even if it happens in front of  their very own eyes.  The amateur video was cast aside as the result of  editing, without telling us how and where this took place. Nobody in the  documentary was aware of the book "<a href="../afos/Jonah/cover_en.htm" class="la">The Prophecy of the Blue Light</a>",  which has specifically addressed the issue of the field shapes in England.  Besides, modern science still views all this as parapsychology.</p>
            <p align="justify">What would happen,  however, if a scientist had this experience? The very work of Nicola Tesla  and the Kirlians gives a very important answer: the area considered belonging  to the invisible over all these years is  now,  scientifically measurable  and recognisable.</p>
            <p align="justify">Stephen Hawking's  opening to the spiritual world is clear from the results of his own work. The  book "<a href="../afos/Hawking/index_en.htm" class="la">A Brief History of Time</a>" in its illustrated version has been  universally read almost as much as the Bible. Hawking, one of the physicists  who has influenced the evolution of  Physics  like very few others in our  days, has a mauve aura.</p>
            <p align="justify">I am thinking that  science is not opposed to spiritual experiences. Precisely through such  experiences it finds new ways of searching and experimentation, expanding the  horizons of humanity. A scientist, apart from  continuous training and  commitment to science bases his or her inspiration on it, that is to say, on what our Guides imbue  in us. Inspiration emanates from the spiritual world so that we bring  new discoveries into effect in our three-dimensional, material world.</p>
            <p align="justify">Let's view the case  of the field shapes in England again. The most important finding is that after scientific measurements  the following came up: in the same field where a shape was engraved, time is different for  someone who is standing outside than for someone who is inside the shape; it is altered inside the  field shape. I wonder why.</p>
            <p align="justify">Most of the time when I  close my eyes, I see these circles, as they appeared in the fields  of England.  They are alive, constantly vibrating inside  and make me feel that the  World is infinite, huge and what I'm experiencing right now is so small, that  if I could see it as a whole, I would say that it looks like a joke.</p>
            <p align="justify">I am completely  open to the new. I feel that the Word is sending us messages for anyone who has  the eyes to see them. I have the feeling that these Golden Globes emanate from  the Word that unites the World.</p></td>
