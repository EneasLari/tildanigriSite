Nixon establishing diplomatic contact with  Communist China - two men of power, <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">two  great leaders</span></em>&raquo; that <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">will be friends</span></em>&raquo;.  At that time the &laquo;<em class="michel">new land</em>&raquo; - that  is, the United States - was at the <em>&laquo;peak</em>&raquo;  of its military <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">power</span>&raquo;.</em> Economically, monetarily, the United States dollar was still very powerful on  the international market.&nbsp; <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">The number being reported to the man of  blood</span>&raquo;</em>, are the final numbers of the  casualties from the Vietnam War being reported to President Nixon after he  ended the American involvement in that conflict. </p>

                <p>President Nixon is  called <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">the man of blood</span>&raquo;</em> even though  he was not the most responsible for it. That lies on the shoulders of the  president preceding him, President Johnson. But they call him &laquo;man of blood&raquo;  because he was Commander-in-Chief during the bloodiest years of that war, even  though he was successful in ending openly  admitted American involment  in that conflict. We  know for sure that secret organizations of American control are still involved  and never became uninvolved in that conflict. It is still going on like a quiet  war. That is why there are sporadic discoveries of American prisoners still  being held over there.</p>

                <p>For even though the  United States has supposedly stopped its involvement and the American public is  not aware of the secret organizations that are involved, the people over there  are aware that they are American organizations. So they consider it right and  proper for them to hold American prisoners. </p>
