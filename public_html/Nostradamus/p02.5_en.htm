The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">fleet</span></em>&raquo;  refers to the German planes flying over and bombing <em>&laquo;the city</em>&raquo; of London and <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">reducing  it to rubble</span></em>&raquo;. The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">fearful globes</span></em>&raquo;  were incendiary bombs. They wanted to provide some light to be able to find their  targets. And so they would drop globes of explosive liquids that would ignite  on contact,<br>
            to help provide light to aim their other destructive bombs by. That  makes sense because they had blackouts during the Second World War. <br>
