Some of the advances being made in conversing with primates are discussed in  the October 1978 issue of &laquo;National Geographic&raquo;. In the 1960s Keith and Cathy  Hayes worked with a chimpanzee for six years and succeeded in teaching it to  orally speak several words. Then, R. Allen and Beatrice Gardner perceived that  the chimp&rsquo;s difficulty in acquiring language was not stupidity, but rather an  inability to control lips and tongue. </em></p></td>

With  incredible patience they succeeded in teaching a chimpanzee to effectively  communicate by using sign language. In 1972 Francine Patterson of Stanford  University of California, began a similar project with a gorilla. The  scientists were surprised to find that the gorilla was calmer and more  deliberate in communicating than the chimpanzee. The apes are not only able to  converse by use of sign language, but are now using computers with speech  synthesizers.</em></p></td>
