            <p>This quatrain contains a date in that last line. The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">fire taking hold in two houses</span>&raquo;</em> indicates a breakdown in  communication between the United States and Russia.

The &laquo;<em class="michel">people getting suffocated or burned</em>&raquo;  indicates that there will be people in both places wanting to keep feelings  from rising high, to try to keep things on an even balance, to talk things out.<br>
              And some will simply  be put in a position where no one will listen to what they have to say so they  have been <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">suffocated</span>&raquo;</em>, so to speak.  </p>

            <p>Picture casting a horoscope for the world in  general, and at a time in this horoscope where the influence of these three  signs are at a low ebb, that should give you an idea of approximately when this  will take place. Particularly in regards to the horoscopes for the two  countries involved.<br>
              <br>
              It would be pretty  hard to do a horoscope for the whole world. It can be done but it&rsquo;s very  complicated. You would have to have my mirror to be able to do it. However, you  could draw up a comparative horoscope between the two countries, using the date of  inception of the present political systems. That is July 2, 1776, for the  United States, and the appropiate date for Russia, close to the beginning of  this century. </p>

I see pockets of much anger, trying to blame one another, while there  are unifying forces that are trying to heal and keep humanity going. The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">false report of Venus</span>&raquo; </em>is a symbol of  someone in disguise, being the loving, feminine, manipulative part, who has  gained confidences. And this group or country has woven a web to poison others&rsquo;  philosophies. Actually some of these quatrains can apply to many times in History. </p>

The Soviet commander of this sub will have secret  orders the rest of the crew are not aware of, basically saying to antagonize  and instigate as much as they can get away with, without necessarily going over  the line. What happens is that he gets carried away and goes too far, but he&rsquo;s  not afraid of punishment because of the general nature of his orders. The  American commander, on the other hand, is in a situation where he had been  ordered to defend the coast of the United States but not to do anything to  start a war.</p>

The U.S. Navy uses this type to  simulate Soviet submarines in these exercises because the Russians have many of  this type still operating.
