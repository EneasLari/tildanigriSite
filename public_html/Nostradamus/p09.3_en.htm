                <p>This refers to conditions that will prevail during the  time of the shift. There will be places that should be having spring or summer,  yet due to the shift will be getting sleet and snow, and the bodies of water  will be iced up &hellip; therefore the <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">mistake  of the month</span>&raquo;</em>: whoever heard of ice skating in June. The place names I  mention refer to places in and around the <strong>Mediterranean</strong> and <strong>Black Sea</strong>. Those countries that  are used to warm weather will be warm no longer. <br>
                  <strong>Iceland, </strong>which is not in the  map of Europe after the shift, will become larger (!) because of all the  volcanic eruptions. Some of the land will be pushed up, but with the earth  shifting, the volcanoes of Iceland will erupt quite a bit and gradually build  up land.<br>
                  The polar caps will melt and the North Pole is going  to shift northwards, back about a quarter down on the other side, closer to  Russia and Siberia.<br>
                  Cities such as <strong>St.  Petersburg</strong> [Leningrad] will be underwater. Much of the northern part of Russia,  known as <strong>Siberia</strong>, will be like a  very large shallow sea. The contour of <strong>Russia</strong> will be reshaped due to the land being compressed. This is caused by the rising  and sinking of pieces of land. <br>
                  He then referred to the <strong>islands off the coast of Portugal</strong>. He indicated that land would be  pushed up to form more islands in that area. The mountainous parts of Europe,  especially the <strong>Alps</strong>, would form the  new shoreline, while most of France and all of the low countries would be  underwater. He saw a strange event happening in the vicinity of the North Sea  and the northern countries. Due to the shifting of the ocean, there would be  volcanic activity in mountains there that are underwater, causing that area to  rise upward, forcing the water of the North Sea to drain out. The new shoreline  would run on this spine of mountains. <br>
                  In the area of <strong>Italy</strong> he said the ocean floor would not rise, but volcanic activity would create part  of the new shoreline there. Scattered islands would be all that would remain of  the country of <strong>Greece</strong>. Italy and Greece have not been designed in the  map of Europe the way they will look after the shift.</p>
