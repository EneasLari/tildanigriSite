            <p>The<em> &laquo;<span class="michel">false trumpet</span>&raquo; </em>refers to powerful leaders who are both  religious and political; men who have made their living being involved with  religion, who in the prime of their lives get involved with politics. These are  fundamentalist-type religious men who distort the word of God and use it for  their own ends. Several of these men are striving for political power and they  are banding together to help as many of them as possible to attain <em>key</em> posts in the government.</p>

            <p>A lot of these posts are not necessarily splashy or public. Maybe a  quiet post tucked away in the bureaucracy somewhere that&rsquo;s in a key spot so far  as the information and power flow is concerned, where they can use it for their  own ends and subtly affect world events to their favor. These men attaining  political power will have repercussions all over the world. It will cause many  countries in the Middle Earth; I mean eastern Europe and western Asia and the  Middle East, the whole area there. </p>

              <p>Leaders of this part  of the world will become very alarmed by the development of things. They will  start changing their laws in reaction to this, making it more difficult for  Americans to travel in that part of the world &ndash;<em>&laquo;</em><em class="michel">cause  Byzantium to change its laws</em>&raquo;. Some laws in particular that will be  changed will be those having to do with the conversion of American money into  other currencies and with trading with the United States. It will have negative  repercussions. As a result of this it will end up affecting the young  Anti-Christ, referred to as &laquo;<em class="michel">Byzantium</em>&raquo;. The young Anti-Christ in his  own country, in the process of building up a power base, will be influenced in  such a way that it will make it more difficult on Christendom in general later  on.</p>

            <p>The fundamentalists will be an element in their own undoing in this  way. These men who appear to be very religious are very shrewd and calculating.  When they go to seminary schools to learn how to be a Reverend and such, a lot  of the things they learn can be used for crowd control and brain-washing and  manipulating people. This is basically what they are doing, but they are for  private, secular things rather than just religious things. What they&rsquo;re really  after is power. </p>
