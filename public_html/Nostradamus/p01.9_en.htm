                <p>I&rsquo;ve always been a little bit odd  and visions of the future were always with me. I&rsquo;d look at people and see  superimposed upon them, visions of how it was going to be for them. And I  realized that I could use this gift to help people. Most of what I do I  discovered on my own. I had discovered that I was able to focus well if I  stared into a candle flame. And so I reasoned that it would be even better if I  used a spirit lamp to burn alcohol in or something similar, to make a purer  flame. </p>

                    <p>I have studied with a few  teachers but not as many as what is thought. Most of the teaching I have had  has been from great teachers of the other plane. Sometimes when I would  meditate I would receive knowledge. &ndash; But I&rsquo;m rather confused as to where I got  the mirror. I am not really sure how that happened. I think that a being of  some sort from another plane or another dimension bestowed it upon me, in order  to be able to make contact between different planes.</p>

                  <p>I was meditating one day and I  saw this being standing before me, talking to me and teaching me. The being  told me I would be able to recontact him and other planes whenever I wanted to.  And I asked &quot;How? I am not that disciplined yet&quot;. And the being said, &quot;You will  know when you return to normal consciousness.&quot; When I returned to normal  consciousness, the mirror was lying before me. </p>

                  <p>I perceive God as  representing wisdom and understanding. I believe my ability to see the future  comes directly from God. Because that&rsquo;s part of what God is, knowing what&rsquo;s  going to happen, or at least knowing the possibilities. I do not agree with  what the church says about God. I believe the church does not have a full  understanding of deity. They are trying to place narrow man-made restrictions  upon Him. When I think about religious things I view it more as a philosophy  rather than as something to be fanatical about. The way I perceive God is  simply through knowledge and developing my philosophy of life through my time.  Off and on throughout my life it&rsquo;s always been somewhat easy to be discouraged  because no one could understand these things that I see all the time. When you  have a gift that nobody else has &ndash; particularly when you&rsquo;re surrounded by  ignorant priests who refuse to acknowledge it as a gift from God &ndash; people find  it very easy to call it a gift from the Devil instead. And so, yes, there were  times when I was very discouraged, because I&rsquo;m human.</p>
