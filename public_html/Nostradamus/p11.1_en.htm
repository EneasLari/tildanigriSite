It will be like the return of  Christ. This gentle man will be one of the highest, most developed geniuses  ever to appear in our present history of man. He won&rsquo;t be feared, he will be  respected. He made the decision to use his genius to help mankind, so he is  always inventing and envisioning things that will help man. Since he&rsquo;s such a  genius there are many people who study under him to try to comprehend the great  fount of ideas that come forth from him. The Great Genius will come the second generation after  the Anti-Christ, in the mid-21st century. If you will observe your history,  the development of our civilization and the development of technology has been  increasing and happening at ever faster rate.</p></td>

He&rsquo;s at a nexus of time lines, but anything he does will  affect the various futures the Earth could travel along. So he was a prominent  light on the landscape of time. He&rsquo;s a very knowledgeable person, and he  decided to apply his remarkability through science rather than through  philosophy, so he could help mankind materially rather than just mentally.</p></td>

Through the succeeding centuries people will grow up and live under the light  of his discoveries and continue to develop themselves. Their continuous development interrelates with  the light he brings as a good teacher. Then, after the allotted time has passed, another discovery will be  made that will be just as awe-inspiring and sweeping  as the genius&rsquo; discovery. It will intermesh so well people will be able to  burst free from all physical bounds and there will be no limit to their  positive development. </p></td>

Once again, showing how history will move in  spirals, there was another man in  the past, Leonardo da Vinci, that was considered a bright light of his time and  well regarded in succeeding centuries. Some of the things this genius will  discover will bring to light even more the greatness that was Leonardo da  Vinci. The most interesting and amazing of Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s discoveries and  inventions had to be hidden or destroyed because of the Inquisition and the  ignorance of the people around him. </p></td>

          <td><p>Leonardo da Vinci was a rare  spirit of invention that could deal with every  subject conceivable! Due to his writing about his own discoveries and making  logical extrapolation based upon his inventions and discoveries, he was able to  explain some of the happenings in the Bible as being due to man&rsquo;s technology  and not due to miracles of God. And this was considered to be very heretical.  It was lessening the glory of God according to the authority in the  church which was never interested in technological interpretations through the  centuries.<br>
          This is another reason for  myself being so obscure in my writings. I have already seen what happened when  someone wrote about these things. People of the church were not discreet about  it &hellip;<br>
          Most of da Vinci&rsquo;s  papers and books have been locked away in the Vatican Libraries. The Vatican  would still not want to release a lot of them. But the majority of them is  tucked away and gathering dust and mostly has been forgotten. </p></td>
