That last line <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">then will the monster be born</span>&raquo; </em>is about when  researchers will develop this ultimate monstrosity in weapons near Ravenna. (In this quatrain Ravenna is also mentioned  referring to a place). This research is already going  on in your present. It will come to fruition during the time of troubles.</p>

                  <p>The word<em> &laquo;<span class="michel">harbor</span>&raquo; </em>means a body of water, an  ocean, separating <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">two</span>&raquo; </em>major <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">cities</span>&raquo;</em>. One of these cities is London  and the other city is New York. Due to some secret research into  bacteriological warfare, two different disease-causing organisms will be  released into the atmosphere in such a way as to affect the population of the two  cities. It will appear to be two different diseases even though it was caused  by the same organism. As a result of this plague the service systems within  these great metropolises will break down. The people in the surrounding  countryside will panic and voluntarily stay away from the city, in effect  putting themselves under quarantine. They will refuse to deliver anything to  the cities, so that the people within the cities will be starving to death due  to lack of food. Not because there&rsquo;s no food to be had, but because no one will  deliver it and run the risk of being exposed to the plague.&nbsp; </p>

              <p>There&rsquo;ll be a group of doctors researching  into the powers of the various energy fields of the earth. This will be a secret government project. They&rsquo;ll try to harness these powers and use them  for various things including warfare. At the time they finally start doing  direct experimentation on the physical world, they will accidentally rupture  one of the earth&rsquo;s fields in such a way that a beam of energy will shoot out  into space and draw a stream of meteorites toward the earth. This will happen  around the North Sea. The meteorites will be drawn toward the earth because of  this alteration of the energy fields around the earth. So in the process of  trying to repair the damage there is an earthquake soon after when the stress  has built up. The three names I use in the quatrain are code words of the  secret project I&rsquo;ve anagramized.              </p>
              <p>People in general may not ever know the  connection of those words with the event, even though some of them may already  be recognizable from various government circles. Those words were partially  reminders to myself as to where I was talking about and partially so there  would be some key words in there that will make sense as time unfolds. People  will of course think this was a spectacular natural phenomenon.</p>
