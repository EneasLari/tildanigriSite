His ascendant is Sagittarius.  The man will be of swarthy complexion and his character can be likened unto the  Tarot card &quot;inverted Hierophant&quot;; this man is a man of mystery, of dark  waters.&nbsp; At the present time (1987) he is  a bishop, dressed in a white robe. He has something to do with the finances of  the church. He&rsquo;s very concerned about the  money the church has, but is losing. He&rsquo;s trying to stem the flow of it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s thinking they might have to sell some  church property in different areas of the world. He&rsquo;s even thinking of going to  Switzerland to get loans and make other financial arrangements. </p>

It will be a congenital defect  in the bone. It won&rsquo;t be caused by injury but he was born that way. In his  horoscope we see a stellium of planets (three or more planets in the same sign)  in the sign of the Ram, Aries. The Sun, Mercury, Mars, and Uranus all take  place in the 5th house of creativity, pleasures and speculation.  With an emphasis on the sign of Aries, the individual will be strong minded and  will &quot;butt&quot; his way to the &quot;top&quot;. The Sun combines with erratic Uranus and  vacillating Mercury, signifying a magnetic personality, a keen mind and a  strong desire to have his way. The Moon is Pisces indicates a sense of  compassion for others that leads him into the priesthood. The Moon in  conjunction with the South Node predicts a need for him to go through an  emotional purification. There will be a strong tie to the mother figure, as  well.</p>

Venus in Taurus in the house of service indicates he will  work well with his colleagues and they can help him attain his ambitions. Mars  in good relation to Saturn portends a strong sense of discipline and the  ability to accomplish goals and projects with great determination. The tendency  to hold in his frustrations could result in bitterness and the inclination for  revenge. Uranus is negative aspect to Pluto predicts a life full of changes and  upheavals that will test the caliber of his spirit.</p>

This man of swarthy complexion and blue eyes entered the  church at a young age out of bitterness and desperation, because he knew he would  never get a girl to love him and marry him. He entered the church so he would  not have to deal with this. His parents were involved with the Nazi movement in  France. Consequently, he is scarred by this as well.</p>

            <p>He had to bear the  taunts of his schoolmates in the years after World War II, of their calling him  &quot;Nazi lover&quot; and such as this. Had it not been for the cruelty and callousness  of the people he was exposed to in his environment, he could have turned out to  be a good man, perhaps even kindly. But as it was, he has been warped into  cruelty from pain and he wants to get back at the world because of the pain he  bore when he was young. <em>&laquo;</em><span class="michel"><em>After conquests he  will murder innocent people</em></span><em>&raquo; </em><strong>(IV-86) </strong>is referring to  the pope figuratively, due to these hurts in his early childhood, will want to show them, saying:  &quot;Look at me, I&rsquo;m powerful. I can do it. I&rsquo;m better than you.&quot; <br>
              And <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">after  conquests</span>&raquo;</em> means that after he attains the power he is desiring, he will be  responsible for the murder of innocent people, just by being the tool of the  Anti-Christ. He will not actually murder people himself, but he will cause  avenues to be opened through which people will be murdered. Particularly, he  will see a chance to hurt those who hurt him when he was young. This pope has the  appearance of being a kindly man at the present time, for that is advantageous  for him. But the hidden is very prominent in his makeup.</p>

              <p>The engraved metals  will be coins with the pope&rsquo;s likeness. It will be his rise and then his  downfall, because of his vanity.&nbsp; I see  much corruption by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. And it will cause  dissension and the complete break up of the Catholic Church. It will break into  many small factions. <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Before the battle the great man will fall, the great one to death,  death too sudden and lamented.

And when he gets rid of him, that will essentially  get rid of the church too.</p>
