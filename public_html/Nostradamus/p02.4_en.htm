            <p>Nostradamus, as Cannon writes,  commented on the major figures that were involved in World War II. Strangely,  when he referred to President Franklin Roosevelt he painted quite a different  picture than people, who were alive at that time in the United States, saw. Personally, Cannon  says, I had always  considered Roosevelt a great man who brought us through the war.&nbsp; </p>

                <p>On the contrary, Nostradamus  referred to him as a man who was able to manipulate his presidential powers to  be almost a king. <strong>(</strong><strong>VIII</strong><strong>-74).</strong>He did serve more terms in office that any other  president, and there was talk at the time that he might become similar to a  king. It was at that time Congress limited the number of terms a president  could serve. He also referred to Roosevelt manipulating to get the country  involved in the war. In CENTURY <strong>I</strong><strong>-23</strong><em>, </em>the<em> &laquo;<span class="michel">leopard</span>&raquo; </em>represents England and the <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">boar</span>&raquo;</em> is the  Nazis because they were a piggish bunch. America is referred to as the &laquo;<em class="michel">eagle  playing around the sun</em>&raquo;, indicating that they were <em>supposedly</em> neutral. </p>

                <td><p>This quatrain mentions a time, &laquo;<em class="michel">the third month at sunrise</em>&raquo;  which is not astrological but referred to the time that England began to feel  threatened by Germany and was trying to get the United States involved in the  war. Nostradamus indicated that Roosevelt had to find a way to enter the war  with the people&rsquo;s support. Research proves this to be accurate. In March 1941,  Roosevelt offered all aid &quot;short of war&quot; to England. His most powerful  opponents accused him of preparing the nation for a declaration of war in order  to help the economy.</p></td>

He  was elected in 1932 and United States entered the war in December 1941.  Although these nine years encompassed the Depression era, they were relatively  peaceful. There were several other quatrains, but these are enough to show the  way Nostradamus saw Roosevelt and the entry of United States into the Second  World War. </p>
