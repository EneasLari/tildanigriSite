            <p>This quatrain concerns Ireland. The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">two flowers</span>&raquo; </em>can either be thought of  as referring to Ireland and Northern Ireland, or to the Protestant Irish and  Catholic Irish. That poor island is so divided against itself that it&rsquo;s best  represented by <em>two</em> flowers rather  than by one. Both groups in Ireland feel they are fighting for the good of  their beloved country. And when it&rsquo;s too late they will realize they have been  tearing her down, so that she will be lost totally.</p>

            <p>At the last minute they will try to  compromise in an attempt to save the situation. The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">snake</span>&raquo;</em> refers to the leader of the rebellious forces and the <em class="michel">&laquo;law&raquo;</em> refers to the forces that are  cooperating with Great Britain. But they will be foiled in their efforts by  various schemes implemented by members of the underworld in the various  locations named in the quatrain. These will be tearing down the situation, both  with supplying faulty arms to both sides and also smuggling in hard drugs and  such to mess up the minds of the people who are fighting.</p>

            <p>Monaco is the point where it&rsquo;s being  channeled through to Ireland. Members of the underworld are in the various  locations described in the quatrain, but they coordinate their efforts and  channel what must be done through Monaco. It seems like an illogical way of  doing it, but through the tenuous connections of the underworld it is the most  direct and logical way of doing it. </p>

          <td width="60%"><p>This quatrain refers to the manner in which the Irish problem will be  resolved. The Irish nation is deeply divided and has been for centuries. Prince  Charles &ndash; <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">the brave eldest son of a king&rsquo;s daughter</span>&raquo;</em> &ndash; or one of his  sons will have a major part to play in bringing peace to Ireland. This man will  find some leverage with which to deal with the problem, in order to bring it to  a head, so that the Irish will have to choose between total destruction and  peace. The Irish nation will be finally united once more; the threat of  destruction will recede. The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Celts</span>&raquo;</em> were originally on the British Isle  in Scotland, Wales and England. The Romans and the Anglo-Saxons drove them  westward across the sea to Ireland where they became part of the Irish people.</p></td>
