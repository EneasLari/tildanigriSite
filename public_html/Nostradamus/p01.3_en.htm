            <p>It is important to  find a good vehicle, a very clear channel. Nostradamus wanted to find a  suitable subject who would have the ability to enter a deep trance level. Once  there, they also must have the ability to translate complex symbolism into  images we can understand. A good vehicle should be educated enough to have an  extensive vocabulary and an intellectual mind so that to be able to interpret  and put into words the concepts he might be shown in the most succinct  manner.&nbsp; He should be able to grasp the  concepts and show them to us in his language. Let us not forget that language  changes through the ages &hellip; In  order for Nostradamus to be able to put across the images, the concepts should be present in  his vocabulary and should also be present in the vehicle&rsquo;s vocabulary. He has  noticed, he says, that if he dictates quickly, before someone has the chance to  think, then the subconscious of the vehicle, which usually confuses things  won&rsquo;t get involved. <br>

          <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify">
            <p>The vehicle must also be  calm, because if he becomes inundated with emotions, if he sees scenes that carry intense feelings of emotion,  he must be dissociated from it otherwise he can&rsquo;t communicate anything through  him. The vehicle should be willing to participate in experimentation, being an  eager and open mind; eager to learn new things and gasping for knowledge. </p>

          <td width="67%" valign="top"><div align="justify">
              <p>Each vehicle has a different feel  when operating through them. Each vehicle has their strengths and weaknesses.  Each vehicle has their own perception of the world and their own ideas  regarding communication and philosophy. Because of this, some of the meanings may  be expressed differently or may seem similar but not the same ideas.              <br>
              The intent and believing that we can contact each  other allows you to accomplish this; the thought pattern the vehicle creates,  his willingness to be a vehicle and listen, and the desire and intent to have  this project accomplished. In that case,  Nostradamus says, I am also open and I am calling forth on the same vibrational  pattern. So it is a mutual desire to have these connections.</p>

            <p>You are right to follow your feelings when  interpreting horological symbols. Your feelings are your psychic guides helping  you as they observe from their higher planes. They thereby contribute towards  your insightfulness in the matter. &nbsp;</p>
