            <p>In  the piece of parchment I&rsquo;m showing to you, I point to February. February 1962.  Anti-Christ&rsquo;s got Aquarius on the ascendant; his birth is straight in Aquarius.  The Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn and the South Node are all aligned in the First House! He must have  been born about sunrise. It&rsquo;s a very uneven-looking chart; there are no  conjunctions in it. Wait a minute. There is a conjunction between &hellip; I think  it&rsquo;s Venus and Mars. There close enough but they&rsquo;re all different degrees. It&rsquo;s  not a real conjunction &hellip; They&rsquo;re all conjuncting by sign, but not by the same  degree. Then I see the planet Pluto in what would be the eighth house on this  chart, in Virgo. This is where his occult energy comes from. As for Neptune, it  is the sign of Scorpio and it takes place in the tenth house.</p>

            <p>The  Sun here, promises an excellent constitution and a desire to &quot;be someone&quot; in  this life. The Moon, here, indicates a very inquisitive mind, scientifically  and intellectually, with a keen awareness of technology. Mercury emphasizes  these traits to a considerable degree. Venus represents emotions that are cool,  calm, and detached. It&rsquo;s easier to be loving to all than just one. Mars, the  planet of action, foretells a drive that functions on pure intellectual energy.  A good grasp of mechanics also goes with this position. Jupiter points to a  somewhat charming and humanitarian personality. The planet Saturn in the First  House portends to obstacles in early life followed by a great discipline to  achieve one&rsquo;s goals. It&rsquo;s interesting that his Aquarian stellium makes an  adverse aspect to Neptune, the planet of compassion in the Tenth House. This  foretells that he will rise to power in a swift but clandestine fashion. Once  in power, he could abuse the privilege. Pluto in the sign of Virgo in the  Eighth House stresses great psychic ability but also a strong manipulative  tendency. Uranus, in the sign of Leo in the Seventh House of partnerships,  represents open &quot;enemies&quot; as well as disruptions in personal relationships.</p>

          <td width="67%" valign="top"><p>This  is a very unusual and intense chart saying this is a very important person. There is great power in this horoscope,  indicating a very advanced soul who has had the &quot;test of power&quot; in previous  lives and is again being tested. He will use this energy for all the wrong  reasons when it could be used for positive reasons. He will have great psychic  powers. The horoscope is in a square and has diamond patterns within it. It  appears that this was how horoscopes were drawn up in that period.</p></td>
