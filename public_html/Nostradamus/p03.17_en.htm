            <p>This refers to events that will  take place during the time of upheavals. There will be an accident, a great  tragedy. It will start out as plans for a war game, plans for an &quot;in case of&quot;  incident. Like &quot;in case thus and such happens, this is the defensive measures  we&rsquo;ll take&quot;. In this particular war game, the teams are labeled the white team  and the blue team with <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">a white leader  and a blue leader</span>&raquo;,</em> as in the manner of military strategy and planning.<br>
              The various sides are labeled  with colors so there&rsquo;ll be a generic situation.              <br>

            <p>There will be a malfunctioning  circuit in the computer that will misfire in such a way that it will cause the  computer to think that it is a real life situation instead of a war game. Hence  the computer will set off the defenses and the weapons involved, and will start  dropping real bombs on the areas involved and cause a tragic international  incident. This particular incident will throw Europe into chaos, trying to  figure out what happened and why.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>This incident will  basically involve European troops. The only U.S. troops that will be involved  will be those stationed in that part of the world at the time. Extra U.S.  troops will not be called in at that time. Because the action of what takes  place is so senseless and so bizarre, it will be obvious that either a madman  got loose with the weapons or that it was a freak accident. After the dust  starts to settle, so to speak, some peace-keeping troops may be called in to  help reestablish civil order. <br>

              &laquo;<span class="michel">Death from the great antenna hanging from the branch</span>&raquo;</em>: on the one hand it  refers to a new type of weapon that will be developed; a type of radio wave  that at certain frequencies and intensities can be lethal. It can cause intense  pain in the nerve endings and destroy certain portions of the brain. At the  same time it also refers to their orders being broadcast by radio from the  computer. The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">branch</span>&raquo;</em> refers to that  part of the computer which malfunctions and it branches off in a different  direction than it should have.</p>
