            <p>&ldquo;I found myself surrounded by a blue light that  appeared to be coming from everywhere&rdquo;, says one of the vehicles that  communicated with Nostradamus. &nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sitting at a table, has a plume in his  hand and the ever-present book in front of him that he writes in; though he looks about to make an opening with us. He looks  towards the glass now. I show him a tape recorder, it looks  unreal to him. &ldquo;A little black box that could capture the words and will repeat  them to me later, seems like magic&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, Dolores replies with  humor. &ldquo;It captures the voice and then gives  it back to us when we want it.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seeing Nostradamus&rsquo;s face more and  more in my mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; says one of the women-vehicles. &ldquo;For some reason I saw  him wearing a wool cap that was pulled down over his ears. It was a difficult  portrait for me to draw and I was not totally satisfied with it. My main  disappointment was that I felt I did not reproduce the intensity of his eyes&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Nostradamus himself  was very emphatic about insisting that he was very much alive, that I was not  speaking to the dead. This point was very important to him. To me he became  very much alive and displayed all the various mixed emotions that mold us into  individual human beings. He was quite a personality: at different times he  would be irritated, impatient, worried or intense. He would often become  angered at how the interpreters had translated his quatrains. At other times he  would convey a genuine sense of humor. At these times he would joke with us and  even become feisty. I knew at all times that I was communicating with a living,  physical human being and not a spirit.</p>

              <p>&ldquo;My emotions after  this <em>encounter</em> with Nostradamus&rdquo;,  Dolores says, &ldquo;ranged a whole gamut from incredulity because I had thought the  project impossible to achieve, to wonder, to ecstasy, and exhilaration over the  actual accomplishment and breakthrough. I felt if this could happen then truly  nothing was impossible. Nothing could hold us back now for we had been able to  transcend the barriers and boundaries of time and space. </p>

            <p>I knew we would be  permitted to return again and again, as many times as we wished, to seek and  find hidden knowledge. I could not even conceive of or imagine what wonderful  adventures and insights might  lie in store for us beyond the portal of the magic  mirror&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I also realized&rdquo;, Dolores says,  &ldquo;that just as it happens in our lives, so it is with the quatrains and separate  phrases of Nostradamus which have multiple meanings because the events are  repetitive moving in a spiral. In several of  the quatrains he would have to combine two and three events and write about them  as if they were one event, so that he could fit them into the quatrain. So, Nostradamus saw History repeating itself, following  similar patterns many times during the five centuries covered by his prophecies.&rdquo; <strong> </strong></p>
