            <p>Because a primary problem will be finding electricity  to power things, solar-powered stations would be able to beam down electricity  which would speed up the rebuilding process. If all of the technology is  limited to the Earth&rsquo;s surface, it&rsquo;s going to be almost completely wiped out.  But if the government plans ahead by allowing man to move into space, then all  will not be lost. There is the possibility that the <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Others</span>&raquo;</em> will help us during the shift, but it depends on how we  handle the situation. If we try to work together in the most positive way  possible, they will come and help. If we react negatively, by detonating  nuclear bombs and such because we think it&rsquo;s the end of the world, then they  will stay away.</p>

Over time  people will become sensitive to inner warnings and won&rsquo;t be caught off guard.  They will be more prepared because they will learn to rely on their psychic  abilities and listen to their inner prompting.</p></td>

            <p>Watch for the order of events. Earthquakes always come  first, earthquakes and erupting volcanoes go together, and they&rsquo;ll be happening  off and on throughout the entire process. There will probably be as much  destruction in Europe and Asia in the way of earthquakes as in the United  States. However, these countries won&rsquo;t be flooded with as much water as the  U.S. will be. Their land masses will be closer together and easier to rebuilt.</p>

That will be more the purpose of the government, rather  than handing down laws for private citizens as they do now. The main focus will  be on space.<br>

Humanity is moving more and more into a psychic and spiritual realm  which will occur at about the same time the axis change takes place. They actually  will be working in conjunction with each other. And when I say &laquo;at the same  time&raquo;, I don&rsquo;t mean within a year. I&rsquo;m talking about within two or three  decades. Psychic awareness gradually evolves more and more to where it is  acceptable to operate this way. Right now, you&rsquo;re into it, but it hasn&rsquo;t  reached an acceptable point with the masses.          </p></td>

            <p>I don&rsquo;t think it will be such a drastic change by that  time, because so many things that are just theories now will be so widely  accepted by then that you will be aware and know about the axis change. You  will anticipate it and be prepared to continue working through it.<br>
              All versions still depict a world that chaos has  forever changed; a planet composed more of water than of land. A world picture  that I hope will never be seen by humans.</p>
