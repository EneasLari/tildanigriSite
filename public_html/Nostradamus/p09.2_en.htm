                <p>It&rsquo;s difficult to distinguish the specific effects of  an axis shift because so many changes will be taking place in the world. There  will be changes world-wide at areas that were unknown to explorers of my time,  but are known to you. For instance, they&rsquo;re not very familiar with Asia, and they  don&rsquo;t know anything at all about Australia or Antarctica. Let&rsquo;s start from the continent of Africa. <br>
                  When the axis shifts it will cause many earthquakes to  occur and volcanoes to erupt. Thus, not only will the water rise and some land  sink, but some of the land will rise as well. <strong>Quite a bit of Africa will be underwater</strong>. In some places where  there used to be land, there may be some scattered islands. The surface of the  Earth won&rsquo;t remain stable: there will be such stress upon the Earth that its  surface will crumble in places like a hard piece of clay. Some pieces will be  forced against the others. This will cause certain areas to be pushed higher  while others will disappear underwater.<br>
                  Nostradamus then pointed to the area around the great  island of <strong>Madagascar</strong> and was  confused over what to call it. The significance of this confusion wasn&rsquo;t  apparent until I did my research. He&rsquo;s pointing to Madagascar but he&rsquo;s calling  it <strong>Zanzibar</strong>. The area surrounding it  will be raised from the ocean bed because of the shifting of nearby land. I  wondered why he ignored Madagascar and focused in on Zanzibar, which is a much  smaller island closer to the coast of Africa. I found that there had been trade  with Zanzibar even before the Christian era, but Madagascar was unknown. It was  discovered in 1500, but was left alone during Nostradamus&rsquo; lifetime because  fierce Arabs controlled the harbors.<br>
                  The left side of the continent will be composed of <strong>many scattered islands</strong>. The part in  between will be like a sheltered bay, because of the curve of the land and the  islands. There will be nothing left in the upper part (the portion that is  mostly desert now). It would be similar to the land shelf off present-day North  America, which sits just under the water, eventually dropping off into deeper  ocean.</p>
