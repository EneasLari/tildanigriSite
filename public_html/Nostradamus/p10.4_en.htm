Atlantis truly did exist, but not in the  form popularly supposed. Many picture it as being a Greek civilization of some  sort with colonnaded temples and such. In truth it was not like this at all.</p></td>

            <p>One thing about  Atlantis that scientists will have to realize is that they used stone the way  the 20th century uses metal. They had ways of working stone, of  making it malleable like clay and then letting it harden again to stone. They  worked with forces and energies that could be conducted through stone the way  electricity is conducted through metal. It was a civilization based on a  totally different concept of the world. Hence, when the archaeologists find it,  it will be difficult for them to understand what they do find.</p>

          <td><p>The civilization of  Atlantis was a world-wide civilization. There have been a few small crumbs of  evidence found already, but scientists have not put two and two together, so to  speak. There&rsquo;s a major city of that civilization on the American eastern  continental shelf. And there is one where the Sea of Japan now is. There is  another major center under the ice of Antarctica. There are evidences of this  civilization in Central and South America. Some of these evidences have been found and some  have not. Some of the megalithic structures about the world are related to this  civilization as well, particularly structures with mathematical preciseness  about them such as the ones in Great Britain. <br>
          You have the idea it  was located on a submerged island somewhere out in the middle of the Atlantic.  At one time part of it was on an island simply because of the levels of the  ocean water. It&rsquo;s now part of a continental shelf because the waters of the  ocean rose sufficiently to cover up this island. But that was not the center of  the civilization nor was it the only place where that civilization existed.  There were all these other places, and they were in communication with one  another for they were one civilization.          </p></td>

          <td><p>Mankind had become  very advanced. Their civilization was advanced in the direction they had grown.  It didn&rsquo;t have the wondrous machines your civilization does, simply because  this civilization had developed in a different direction. Man relied more on  the PSI part of the abilities of the mind to accomplish things rather than  relying on the nimbleness of fingers to do it. Consequently, civilization had a  totally different pattern, and with this use their abilities became quite  common.</p></td>

            <p>When the civilization  seemed to be at the point of really flowering and coming into its own  fulfillment &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure if some extraterrestrial civilization intervened or  if a natural accident simply happened. If a natural accident happened, it seems  like the Earth and the solar system somehow went through a cluster of asteroids  and such. But if it was not an accident but by design, then some  extraterrestrial civilization gathered together these asteroids and such, and  the Earth passed through them. And these huge chunks of rock racing through the  atmosphere and hitting the ground messed up the climate and caused shock waves.  Quite a few of them landed on some of the cities and destroyed them totally. It  happened in such a way that mankind lost every vestige of civilization it ever had  and had to start from scratch again. Some evidences of these huge pieces of  rock that struck the Earth can be seen. These rocks, even though some of them  were irregularly shaped, have left behind basically round impact points. You  can easily see this by getting a good map drawn by a mapman with a steady hand.  You&rsquo;ll notice there are some bodies of water that are basically round. The Sea  of Japan, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and others throughout the world  mark some of the places where these huge rocks struck the Earth and the ocean  waters came flooding in, destroying the survivors.</p>
