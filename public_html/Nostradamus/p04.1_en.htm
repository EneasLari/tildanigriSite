            <p>The translators all agree that when I spoke about this personality known as the  Anti-Christ I referred to three different men. Napoleon  was one, but that&rsquo;s strictly from a European view-point because he mainly  affected Europe and that was it, although it was devastating enough. The second  one, regardless of your viewpoint, is very clear. That would be Adolf Hitler.  What Hitler did and what the coming Anti-Christ will do will affect the whole world and not just Europe.</p>
