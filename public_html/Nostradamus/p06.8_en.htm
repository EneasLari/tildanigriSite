But they will be unmarked so that no  one will know who they belong to. It will be strongly suspected they come from  a strong western power who is still officially neutral. Not to mention any  names, but their initials are U.S. </p>

              I&rsquo;m trying to point out to both the church  people of my day and the church people of the present day, that on the other  side of the veil it&rsquo;s very different from what they picture it to be. So it  will be very <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">foreign</span>&raquo; </em>to their  concepts. This meaning really does not relate to the rest of the quatrain, but  I was still trying to get that information across.&nbsp; <br>
              The USA will not solve its  deficit problem. It is beyond control now and it will continue to  snowball.&nbsp; When that reaches the ultimate  horrible conclusion, it will have a destabilization effect all over the world. </p>
