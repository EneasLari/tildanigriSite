This project lasted for ten years, from  1982 till 1992, during which many different people served as  <a href="p01.3_en.htm" class="la">channels</a>, many people were willing to help with this work; people from different educational backgrounds,  personalities and life orientation. <br>

The spirits on the earth at this time are here  because they chose to be here, because they knew that they will be working  through large amounts of major karma. You will find them everywhere, in the  most unexpected places. Old souls will be in communication with each other and  thanks to them the situation will be kept in balance. </p>

            for communicating with these quatrains was to try to at least alter, if  not prevent, the worst aspects of these events from coming up. Whether the  events are altered or not, even if the very worst that can happen happens, there  will still be a great spiritual rebirth throughout the entire world.          </p></td>

            <p>And during the time of troubles,  people individually will have opportunities to get in touch with themselves and  realize that the materialistic values were false. After the time of troubles  when people start communicating with each other again, they will find out that  other people realize this also. This will cause a great rebirth of philosophy  and a great blending of the best aspects of eastern and western religions. It  will result in a worldwide movement of philosophical thought that is in accord  with what people know and feel to be true. This will bring about the best  aspects of the Age of Aquarius. If people could realize this ahead of time and  hold on to this ray of hope, then they could alleviate some of the worst  aspects of this time of troubles that is coming. But I fear it may be unlikely  that this could happen in any widespread form, due to the materialistic values  held by the majority of the populace.<br>
              <br>
              I&rsquo;m trying to get the news to  people in enough time so that they can perhaps change their minds about some  things and avert the worst of it.</p>
Finally, I&rsquo;m hoping these messages I&rsquo;m trying to  convey will get across in time. I&rsquo;m hoping the people will be open enough to  accept this and perhaps help with spreading this core of knowledge to help  avert the disasters that I have seen, for they are avertable.</div></td>
