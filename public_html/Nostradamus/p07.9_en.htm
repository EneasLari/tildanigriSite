                <p>This one has a  multiple meaning. Such quatrains are easy enough to interpret into multiple  meanings because of the disasters that happen from time to time in earth&rsquo;s  history. One of the minor implications of this quatrain has happened in what  you would consider the recent past, that is the earthquake in Mexico City  (September 1985). But that  is not the major impetus of the quatrain. This will  be an earthquake that will be triggered by a weapon that is currently being  developed in secret underground laboratories. I cannot put across the images of  how this weapon works, <strong>for the concepts  are not present in my vocabulary and they&rsquo;re not present in this vehicle&rsquo;s  vocabulary either</strong>. It apparently will be working on some scientific  principle recently discovered that has not really been developed yet.</p>

                <p>So the concept of it  is not generally available to be learned. The only thing I&rsquo;m putting across  clearly is the operating part of this weapon, the part that actually triggers  the earthquake. I&rsquo;m not sure, or rather the concepts are not clear as to  whether it is something that is dropped or something that is projected like a  laser ray, but whatever the actual operating point of the spear is, so to  speak, it is airborne. Some extension of the device is carried in a plane and  the plane must fly over the area where the earthquake is to be or at least fly  over the area where the earthquake must be triggered, regardless of the area  the earthquake ends up affecting. </p>

                  <p>But that will not be  the entire device. That will simply be like the point of the spear, just the  operating part of it. The power behind the weapon and the science behind it  will be based in a secret underground laboratory elsewhere. Somehow the power  from the underground laboratory will be linked to the airborne device in such a  way as to be able to channel it to the desired effect of a triggered  earthquake. This could possibly be done in some sophisticated way by directing  sound waves toward the target. The country that develops this device will be  able to hold it as a major threat over the heads of all the major nations. Any  nation can be intimidated that has any geological faults in their country that  are susceptible to earthquakes.</p>

It might be a nation like Russia, or  a nation with the power behind it to have secret military research going on in  a big way, on a large scale. The attitude this nation will have is that, &quot;the weapon is mine. I&rsquo;m going to keep it to  myself&quot;. It&rsquo;s a paranoid nation that will have it and this will cause the  disintegration of the United States.</p>

It&rsquo;s already in the process of being developed  but it&rsquo;s extremely secret. When it becomes more generally known, it will be  that date. There will be an earthquake associated with it. That&rsquo;s how people  will come to realize there is something fishy going on. For there will start  being a lot of earthquakes without the previous buildup of pressure associated  with them. One side effect of this weapon is that it will create sufficient  instability to set off other earthquakes that are apt to go at any time anyway. </p>

                  <p>I&rsquo;m picturing the two  major fault systems in the United States. One is particularly unstable. The  other one stays stable but then is explosive. The San Andreas and the New  Madrid faults. The earthquakes triggered by this weapon will cause the San  Andreas fault to rumble all the time. The New Madrid fault has always been bad  to build up the pressure and then explosively quake.</p>

                  <p>So with the San  Andreas fault continually rumbling and vibrating it will set off the New Madrid  fault into a major earthquake. When these earthquakes initially start happening  the geologists will think it&rsquo;s by natural causes, but then some of the  information will not point to natural causes and they&rsquo;ll begin so suspect  something. As more earthquakes happen, through their science they gather more  information and confront the scientific world with the evidence they have that  these are not natural earthquakes.</p>

The Russians developed a machine (called  &quot;gyrotron&quot;), based on Tesla&rsquo;s invention, designed to &quot;sweep the sky of  warplanes&quot; by using high-energy microwaves. These high-power microwave weapons  would give the operator the same ability to wipe out electronic circuits as a  nuclear blast would provide.
