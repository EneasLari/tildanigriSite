            it was  true and authentic contact with Nostradamus himself each time, especially  considering that for 10 years I worked<br>
            with him through  several people, in fact changing innumerable channels throughout<br>
            our  communication?&quot; </p>

          <td><p>Nostradamus suggested  a test to perform with various subjects to see if we were<br>
            in contact and verify  that we had a true contact: He said if they gave the same translation to a  quatrain chosen by me &ndash;not word  for word, but the same concept - then I would know<br>
            it was a true communication. Needless to say he passed the  test he had imposed upon himself.<br> 
              Personally, from the moment we  started the process, I felt that I was actually<br>
              in communication with him and I  didn&rsquo;t need proof. The similarity between  the information given by all involved can only be marveled at. There were no  contradictions, only extra pieces added to the growing puzzle. He bombarded me  with so much more information<br>
              and similarities that I needed that I knew it  couldn&rsquo;t be a coincidence. For the sake of my readers and for all the skeptics  reading this text I cite the quatrain and its interpretation:           </p>

One  interpretation refers to the man who will rise as <a href="p11.1_en.htm" class="la">an antidote to the Anti-Christ, the Great Genius</a>. The phrase <em>&quot; <span class="michel">he will expose the false topography</span>&quot;</em> means he will show that the way things are looked upon, they have a false  appearance; that the philosophies and sciences have been built upon mistaken  premises, thereby building a mistaken picture of the universe.<br>

They will be linked  together in a cohesive manner to explain earlier versions of major religions  that will seem totally topsy-turvy in the way they&rsquo;ve been interpreted through  the years, thereby black appearing to be white. The new interpretations of  these, based on the new understanding of old writings that had been obscure  before, will make so much more sense to people it will replace the old way, the  narrow-minded way, of looking at things. Simply because this discovery that is  initially pictured as being a discovery in science will be more metaphysical than  is first realized. And it will make clear the connections between the physical  universe and<br>
            the metaphysical universe as dealt with by religions.</p>

People will be able to free their  inner selves and open themselves up to the higher powers and the higher levels  of the universe. In effect, it will make every person a philosopher as they  will be open to these things, whereas before only philosophers were. As a  result, the sects and religions that embrace these newly-discovered true  principles will be very widespread as people will want<br>
            to get together and  share their experiences in exploring<br>
            these upper regions.

            a trace of psychic ability. Through this he gave an interpretation  of these documents that was partially correct and partially incorrect. But he  used this interpretation of these documents<br>
