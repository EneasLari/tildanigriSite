            <p>&ldquo;My quatrains&rdquo;,  Nostradamus said, &ldquo;were not totally in French; there are some Latin  influences&rdquo;.<br>
&ldquo;I usually used  anagrams whenever I was writing about something that was politically sensitive  and would be somewhat untactful to use the straight words. In my time, the  noblemen carry a lot of power. I would not want to get them angry with me  because they would have me arrested and then I couldn&rsquo;t write any more  quatrains. So I&rsquo;m willing to go to certain lengths to disguise what I write, so  long as it does get written.</p>

          <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">
            <p>Now in some of the  other quatrains I use anagrams because the subject matter is very sensitive for  the time that it&rsquo;s referred to. It would not be good for the general public to  know what I&rsquo;m writing about, because I might cause a panic or something like  that. So I use anagrams so that those who are knowledgeable on such things can  figure it out; because those who are knowledgeable are usually in a position to  do something about it.<br>
              <br>
              Some of the skeptics have been  questioning me about both my medical work and about my work with these prophecies;  they&rsquo;ve been putting out negative forces and influences which would interfere  with what I was trying to do. Skeptics are as eternal as weeds, and about as  viable. You must realize that I had to deal with a lot more ignorance than you  have ever had to try to conceive. There have also been some threats made by the  church. <br>
              <br>
              They&rsquo;ve tried to get me not to publish  certain predictions or trap me with some of my predictions, trying to make it  sound like I had committed heresy. They&rsquo;ve tried to bribe and blackmail me with  money. And they&rsquo;ve tried to get me to alter certain predictions to suit their  needs. The church is not a religious institution. It&rsquo;s one of the largest  political institutions on the earth. They don&rsquo;t care, they don&rsquo;t give a fig  about the religious aspects. They use that to help carry out political  manipulation. And they do so to make things more convenient for themselves. </p>

                <p>So far as I can tell, the priests  really were not ever very effective at changing my quatrains. I know that if I  word them the way I do they don&rsquo;t really make sense to the priests and such who  would be reading it. So they wouldn&rsquo;t know where to change it in the way that  they want it. <br>
Some of the changes that have  taken place in the quatrains have been due to poor typesetting rather than  deliberate errors. I assume that you know there has been some poor translation  as well. This is also due to the fact that I was using names of towns to refer  to those countries where the event would take place. I used symbology to confuse the Inquisition but not to  make it too puzzling to future generations. I also used classical references so  that the Inquisition thought I was merely making a comment on history. </p>

                <p>I also want to remark, with a  touch of humor, that whatever puzzles mankind  keeps his attention the longest. Two examples are Atlantis and myself. I  have been surrounded by a mystique that has persisted for 400 years. This is  undoubtedly part of the reason my works have survived.  Some of my prophecies are written in puzzle form. Some others are  disguised, out of fear. Some just seem nonsensical, to confuse and misinform.  Others, if you had depth and awareness, you could understand.&rdquo; </p>
