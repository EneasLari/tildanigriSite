This is when the Anti-Christ comes to power using conventional warfare but with  a very strong threat of nuclear force. He will not actually have the material  on hand for a nuclear confrontation, but the people he&rsquo;s confronting don&rsquo;t know  this. He acts so aggressively they&rsquo;re convinced he can carry through with his  threat of nuclear force. It will be a successful bluff; the same method Hitler  used. Some people in other countries will have nuclear weapons. Some of them  will use small-scale atomic weapons, but most of them will hold back because  they wish to avoid a nuclear confrontation. It will be a very touchy situation.  &laquo;<em class="michel">The Sun will burn the great plain</em>&raquo; refers to a certain amount of nuclear confrontation that will exist during the  time of troubles.</p></td>

The last line <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">letters hidden in the candle</span>&raquo; </em>refers to  the fact that clandestine organizations will be very plentiful and pervasive  causing everyone to be careful about what they say. Many people will be members  of various underground organizations as well as organizations for espionage.  And one will have to guard one&rsquo;s words carefully and figure out novel ways of  communicating in order to not be betrayed. </p>
