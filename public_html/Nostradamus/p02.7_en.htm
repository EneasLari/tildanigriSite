                  <p>Hitler was trying to  take over Russia and Europe, and eventually he was going to try and take over  the United States. The Japanese were taking over Mongolia, Siberia, China,  India, Australia and that part of the world. They planned to help take over the  Americas from the the other coast, so that the people of the Western Hemisphere  would have a two-front battle to fight. Meanwhile <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">the victor born on American soil</span>&raquo;,</em> the element that was to  determine which side of this conflict would win; and that was none other than  the atomic bomb.</p>

                  <p>There were two main  scientists whose brains figured out the theoretical information needed to  develop the bomb.  In this quatrain I  dated this conflict. The time element involved was from the time that the  Americans became involved in World War II: <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">three  years and seven months later</span></em>&raquo; would be when the Americans, bearing <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">the victor</span></em>&raquo;, would end the war by  dropping the bomb,  changing the concept of  violence forever. </p>

They were able to break  through conventional thinking and bring forth the various theories and  mechanizations of nuclear power. </p>

And &laquo;<span class="michel"><em>being poisoned with the roe of a barbel</em>&raquo;</span>  represents its disastrous attempt to take over Russia. I used that symbolism  because in both my time and yours, one of the main things that Russia is famous  for is caviar. Hitler broke all peace treaties and although the different countries around him were <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">strong</span>&raquo;, </em>&laquo;<em class="michel">he bound them up with chains</em>&raquo; because he was acting so audaciously  they did not know how to react.&nbsp; </p>
