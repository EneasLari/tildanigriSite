            <p>This refers to various events in American history. This is one of those  quatrains with several interpretations. &laquo;<em class="michel">The house</em>&raquo; refers to the  White House. One of the things I  was seeing that I did not bring out very strongly was the events of Watergate.  I wanted to give a hint about Watergate because that would be a bad thing to  happen, but not necessarily avoidable.</p>

            <p>There will be a time  in another period of great social unrest, even more major than the social  unrest that occurred during the Vietnam era. I saw the concept of a hung jury,  so that a sentence cannot be decided upon in court, but I&rsquo;m applying that  concept to an election. A hung election with  the nation being the hung jury, and with the vote being very finely divided  between two different men for president. <br>
              <br>
              The electoral college  will not be able to make the decision either because the vote will be so even,  so finely divided throughout the entire nation, that it will temporarily freeze  the processes of democracy. The people will be clamoring for whichever  candidate they voted for and it will cause a great noise across the entire  nation. It will be a touchy subject due to the world situation in general at  the time.</p>

            <p>Thus, if one or the  other candidate is put in office it would be at the risk of causing another  civil war or at least a revolution. It will be a while before they work out a  compromise and hold another election to come up with a candidate acceptable to  all, one who can be installed in the White House without the threat of all the  noise and confusion. <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Digging in dreams</span>&raquo;</em> means that in the process of trying to find a solution to the problem there  will be a lot of oratory.</p>

              <p>In the case of  Watergate, <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">the bones of the hands and  feet being locked up together</span>&raquo;</em> refers to the president abusing the powers  of the CIA for the interests of his political party against the other political  party. It was like cutting off your hand or cutting off your nose to spite your  face, for both parties want to work for the good of the country. And they let  petty things, party differences, get in the way and become too big. The  president abused his powers at the time of election against the other party so  that it created a great noise.&nbsp; </p>

(A play on words: the opening of a water gate would make a loud noise &ndash; <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">because of the noise the house is  uninhabited for a long time</span>&raquo;).</em> It was not settled until the president  stepped down from his position so that things could be quitened and another put  in his place.<br>
              <em><br>
              Note: We could understand the comparison now. In both  cases someone would have to be appointed to fill the office until a president  could be duly elected. This is what he meant by &laquo;<span class="michel">the house being uninhabited</span>&raquo;.  There was a period of time, in Watergate and in this future case, when the  country was being run by someone who had not been elected by the people.</em></p>

            <p>The man who took the  office &ndash; Gerald Ford- was in a very delicate position for he had been appointed  vice president after the other one had been impeached. Then the president  resigned so he became president without ever having received a vote from  anybody, except for his constituency in Michigan. Ford was in a very  uncomfortable position. He did not ask for that to happen to him. He had not  aimed for the presidency. The man did well in the circumstances and the way he  handled the entire situation on his part caused a lot of good causes for his  karma. The house was inhabited but it was not inhabited by an elected  president. This other meaning about the election is more important because the  Watergate episode has already passed.          </p>

There&rsquo;ll be a mistake made and an element  in the water will react with the radioactive elements of the reactor and will  cause an accident to take place.
