            <p>This is an event that  will take place close to the beginnings of the war caused by the Anti-Christ.  This will precipitate England&rsquo;s involvement with this great war. <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">The English Prince, his heart held by Mars  high in the heavens</span>&raquo; </em>, is a young man of the English royal house who is  eager to lead the troops into battle. He will be anxious to go. He will be in  two major engagements and in one of them he will be defeated. He will be  outflanked on the field and he will have to retreat in disgrace. The troops  that he was fighting against will spit at him and use his name as a curseword,  for he was a good fighter even though he was defeated.</p>

For trying to help and  for carrying the English name and honor bright into battle. The part <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">they will pierce him in the gall bladder</span>&raquo; </em>means they will outflank him and <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">pierce</span>&raquo; </em>his forces in the side and hence defeat him.</p>

              <p>It refers to the fall of the English royal house. The quatrain predicts  a combination of the male descendants of the family either being killed in  battle or dying from a disease released from biological bombs designed to  affect only men. The enemy will have biological bombs that release viruses  killing all of the soldiers. Slashing the fighting forces so they&rsquo;ll have less  soldiers to confront on the battlefield. But the bomb doesn&rsquo;t discriminate. It  also affects men who are not fighting, such as older men at home and young  boys. This bomb is only going to be dropped on England. But the doctors in  England will be able to create a vaccine or a serum that will counteract the  effects of the virus and help make people immune to it.</p>

              <p>This refers to two  events. On the one hand it refers to the way things were between the United  States and England during World War II, and how they managed to keep the <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">shipping lanes open</span></em> <span class="michel"><em>between the two countries</em></span><em>&raquo;</em>. It also  refers to the time of the Anti-Christ. The Anti-Christ, during his European  campaign, will also attempt to take over Great Britain &ndash;<em> &laquo;</em><em class="michel">London  fearful of the fleet when sighted</em>&raquo; - but not be entirely  successful. Part of the reasons for this will be because there will be the  support of the United States behind England, once again. So Great Britain, being  a prime maritime power will be able to reassert  herself. </p>

              <p>The more stubborn  supporters of the underground will flee to Ireland and Scotland. He will not be  successful in taking over the <em>entire</em> island. Then you&rsquo;ll have kind of like a &quot;rump&quot; United Kingdom. You&rsquo;ll  understand me if you recall your history of World War II, when the Germans took  over part of Czechoslovakia. Two-thirds of Czechoslovakia was part of Nazi  Germany and the remainder of Czechoslovakia put together a rump government.  Thus, they will have a rump United Kingdom. The majority of England will be  under the power of the Anti-Christ. But North England, Scotland and Ireland  will not be under is power. <br>
                <br>
              Hopefully this event  taking place has the possibilities of uniting Ireland. Because if England is  taken over, she will not be able to do anything about Northern Ireland, so  Ireland can reunite itself the way it&rsquo;s been wanting to be reunited for  centuries. When England is taken over by the Anti-Christ, they will be in no  position to have any say-so as to what goes on in Ireland. And so Ireland will  be able to apply its own remedies to its problems, and turn its dynamic energy  towards other problems, such as the Anti-Christ. And the Irish spirit, being  strong and valiant as it is and the Scottish stubbornness will play a good ways  toward helping the underground movement to survive the worst of the worst days  and eventually conquer the Anti-Christ. When all this is over, people who are  Scottish and people who are Irish will be proud that they are, because of the  role Ireland and Scotland will play.</p>
