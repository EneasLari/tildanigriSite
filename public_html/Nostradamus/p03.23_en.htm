This organization has been in existence for several  generations. They actually control the world history without being either  presidents or kings. A hint to their existence is to trace the family histories  of the banking powers and the money powers in the world. Banking families and  other commodity-related families, such as families into gold mines and diamond  mines, leather, tins and such as this; the basic colonial barons associated  with the European world empires who started their families&rsquo; fortunes by  exploiting the raw materials of the Third World nations.</p>

Increasing population is their major problem. Of  course the four members will be replaced, becoming a group of seven again.
