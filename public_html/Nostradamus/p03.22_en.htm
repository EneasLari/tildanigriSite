But  some of the vials and containers being used in the biological experiments  contain organisms hardy enough to survive the fall. Since these have been  exposed to the cosmos they will be different to what they were before. And  these organisms have the potential of causing plagues. The astrological  notations there at the end are like a horoscope of the date.&nbsp; <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Mercury  in Sagittarius</span>&raquo;,</em> is easy enough to observe. Just look at the sky at night  with a telescope. And <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Saturn warning</span>&raquo;, </em>for  a drawer of horoscopes to draw up a horoscope when Mercury is in Sagittarius  and Saturn is in a bad house for both America and France. It will be then.<br>

              The translators said  that by interpreting the astrological signs as a conjunction that this quatrain  would happen in the year 2044. The disaster will sadden both these nations and  sympathetic nations, and they will work together to find out what happened. </p>

            <p>The first event this  one refers to is the Tunguska disaster in the early part of our century; the terrible  explosion of unknown origin that occurred in Siberia in the early 1900s. It leveled  the forest over a 30-mile radius, killing mostly wildlife since this area was  sparsely populated at that time, and rendering the land radioactive and  useless. There have been many theories brought forth to explain this. The most  common one is that a meteorite hit the earth at that point. But would that  explain the radioactivity? Russian scientists have now offered the possibility  that a spacecraft may have crashed there. </p>

            <p>This quatrain has a  multiple meaning. One of the interpretations refers to an event that has  already taken place. It is an event that actually did happen, but at the time  it did, it was considered to be a rumor rather than an actual event. One aspect  of this quatrain has to do with the Russian space program. Back in the early  seventies when Russia and America were trying to outdo each other in regards to  accomplishments in space flights, particularly <em>manned</em> space flights, Russia embarked upon an ambitious project.  They decided that since they had not been successful in having a manned flight  to the moon, in the process of trying to salve their hurt pride they reasoned  that they would do something better and not worry about the moon. </p>

I saw that astronauts had been lost since the beginning of space  exploration, by not only the United States, but Russia and other countries.  Unknown to the outside world, other countries besides the two super powers were  conducting space experiments in the early days of space travel. Many of them  stopped experimentation after disastrous results. Many of the so-called  &quot;unmanned&quot; flights actually contained astronauts who died or were lost in space  during unsuccessful missions.</p>

            <p>This will set the  space program back temporarily. But the time element involved will be longer  that what is originally anticipated, because right now it has caused a great  division in the ranks. It&rsquo;s like a two-headed serpent fighting itself. Each  division is trying to get the upper hand so as to direct the space program in  their desired direction. By the time this is resolved the implementation of the  decision will be delayed by war. It won&rsquo;t be until the war is over and things  have settled down and the country has recovered from the war, that the space  program will be implemented in the direction of the development of solar power  and space stations. The idealists will eventually win out, but it will be a  very close decision. The advent of war will help strengthen their position.</p>

            <p>This quatrain refers  to an event, the roots of which have already been laid but the outcome will not  come to light for a while yet. The phrase <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">more  than eleven times the moon will not want the sun</span>&raquo;</em>, refers to the United  States&rsquo; space program and the manned flights to the moon. The moon at that time  was very prominent in men&rsquo;s thoughts, thereby raised in glory and more  important. Therefore she was not needing or wanting the influence of the sun to  add to her glory.</p>

            <p>But then the space  program will fall into disfavor so that the glory of the moon is lessened  through policy changes in the government, and the emphasis is shifted in a  different direction. And the change of emphasis is due to some - I insist on  using the word &quot;nefarious&quot; &ndash; nefarious policy - making behind the scenes the  voting public is not aware of, but would not approve of if they knew of it.  These policy changes of redirecting the money toward military things rather  than scientific things will contribute to the horrors of the changes that are  to come. But the machinations behind the scenes will not be exposed until a  late date. <em>(The moonshots went up to  number eleven before Neil Armstrong landed on the surface. The missions were  named after Apollo, the Greek sun god)</em>.<br>
              <br>
              <em>&nbsp;&laquo;<span class="michel">One will sew little gold</span>&raquo; </em>means that when the change of policy takes place it affects the money  available for contributing to the moon&rsquo;s glory; that is, the money availabe for  space programs. It is diverted for other uses and since no money is contributed  into the space program, they cannot return in kind. Because when money is  contributed to research that the space program is involved in, they return in  ten-fold by the discoveries that are done to help improve the lot of mankind. &laquo;<em class="michel">After  famine and plague the secret will be discovered</em>&raquo; means after the time of  troubles.</p>
