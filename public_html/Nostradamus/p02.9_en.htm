This was a time of great unrest in both  countries. Russia was trying to rebuild the damages from the war and modernize  simultaneously, and this was causing a lot of social stress. Stalin was having  his purges at the time, and people kept getting killed for no reason from the  secret police killing imagined enemies of the state. Also at this time the  United States was having great social unrest due to the paranoia about  communism, as stirred up by McCarthy and others thinking along the same lines.  Both countries had building paranoia. </p>

                  <p>At the time people  realized they had come within a very close distance of breaking out into open  conflict, but nobody on this level can realize just how close they came to  getting involved in open warfare. That was a major turning point along the  branches of time. A major dividing branch where they would go one way and start  working out their problems and come to peace, or at least to being on speaking  terms, as they are today. Or they could have broken out in warfare and in the  process destroyed most of Europe from throwing weapons and bombs at each other.  Since this was a major branching point along the pathways of time, it stood out  very clearly and it was fairly easy for me to spot. </p>
