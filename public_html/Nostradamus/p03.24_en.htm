Unfortunately there will not be a cure for it in time for this plague. Death  will just have to run its course. <br>

            <p>The damage was supposed to be  localized, by being introduced into a certain part of  a country during times of war, but it spread worldwide. It was developed in 1960s for the war in Southeast Asia,  but it never was successfully used for that purpose. The purpose for creating  the drug was an experiment. The end result was annihilation.<br>
              You must understand,  scientists create in a laboratory out of a sense of duty of their country. They  have no idea what the end result of their creations will be. This is apparent  when you look at the atomic bomb, and many types of chemical warfare. </p>
