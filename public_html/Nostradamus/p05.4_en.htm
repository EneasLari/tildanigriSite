                <p>This particular pope  has his ecclesiastical roots in Burgundy. If he had his preferences, he would  prefer to have the Papacy based in France rather than in the Vatican. When the  last pope changes his loyalties from the church to the Anti-Christ an explosion of a  fantastic, very advanced satellite will be caused. The Vatican could be able to  see that the traitor was in its own inner and high ups sources when that horrible  accident had already been past. Treachery  had come from &laquo;<em class="michel">Burgundy</em>&raquo;. <br>
                  The last pope who is  of service to the Anti-Christ voluntarily contributes the inner resources of  the information that he, as pope, has access to. Information that the  Anti-Christ could not have gotten in a million years just through his spies:</p>

                  <p>This secret branch of the priesthood is like a private  army, and the commander-in-chief is the pope. Their job is to fight for the  church if the need should arise, similar to the way the Jesuits used to be the  soldiers of Christ. The members of this particular order of priesthood will be  very finely educated, trained in all of the martial arts and all ways of  committing violence.<br>
                    But when the pope sells out and allies himself with  the Anti-Christ, it in effect leaves this army leaderless. What can they do but  howl all night and try to figure out a solution? The evening of the same day  the members of the select guard of the pope&rsquo;s personal army, which has been  left leaderless, will anxiously try all night to decide what to do. </p>
