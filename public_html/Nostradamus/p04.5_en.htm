            <p>I can see why my  translators relate this quatrain to Hitler and where they would get that, but I  was mainly talking about the Anti-Christ. He will be following Hitler very closely.  He will use guile with everybody. Remember your history books. From your point  of view it&rsquo;s the past, although it&rsquo;s the future for me. Remember how Hitler  talked his way into a lot of concessions that no one else would have dreamed of  asking for. <br>
              <br>
              In the beginning he will be looked up to as a world  savior. He will have wondrous inventions that he will market and use to help  people. He will make advances in computers, hydroponic gardening and in farming  intensively to help alleviate hunger in the starving nations. People will look  up to him because he will make a lot of money for them. He will be quite  innovative, and this is how he will rise to power. He will appear to be a <em>spiritual</em> leader, but not in the  conventional religious sense. He will have the power to use his energies on a  high level to the point that he will even invent a computer that will function  from a psychic brain level.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              A person will  be able to turn it on by mentally commanding it, rather than even speaking to  it. He will be able to control all computers that are networked &ndash;  communications systems, satellite systems, and things of this type - at this <em>present</em> time throughout the world.  Gaining the key to that system will give him a sense of power and when the  mantle of complete evil takes over he will start exterminating the people he  feels are useless to his system. This is when the chaos and the rebellion begin.  We&rsquo;ve also translated quatrains that said he would assassinate the leaders of  the world; in a way he is assassinating them just by having them under his  control. </p>
