            <p>The task of organizing  the material and presenting it to the world &hellip; The arrangement of the quatrains  in some kind of chronological order has been a big job because they often refer  to more than one event and the events are in different time periods.  Nostradamus himself pointed out that the number of years into the future he was  seeing had no limit. He could see, he said, not to the end of time but to the  end of Earth. Some of the quatrains were difficult to date because he also  foresaw an even more terrible time in the far future when the changes in the  earth would be very drastic. </p>

            <p>He says it&rsquo;s hard for him to  spot the location because of the turmoil of the time lines at this point in  time; since we are nearing close to the events to happen it causes an effect  somewhat like a thunderstorm in the time lines.&nbsp; From his standpoint, an event that will happen in  30-35 years seems so close, that the time we are talking about it and the time  when the event happens, practically coincide. When he sees that point in time  it&rsquo;s like a storm cloud that&rsquo;s building upon itself and flashing out lightening  in all directions.</p>

The <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">time lines</a>, look like a gigantic emission-line spectrum which is a very small portion of the entire landscape in general. This is just a section of the timescape I'm looking at. There are many possible realities, or possible futures. These lines go along neatly, nicely and orderly, and suddenly they all run together into a central point. That's what I call a nexus.  The Anti-Christ is at a main nexus, and no matter which time line you go down, he's going to be involved. The Great Genius is at another nexus. He's like a bright light on the horizon. </p>

              <br>
              You must believe it, it really is possible to avoid some of the so-called &quot;worse-case  scenarios&quot; he&rsquo;s seen and help lessen the destruction. One example is <u><a href="p05.1_en.htm" class="la">the "assassination" of Pope John Paul II </a></u>for whom Nostradamus is  categorical! As we already know, there was an  attempted assassination against him, from which although he was in serious  danger, he managed to survive. </div></td>

            <p><a href="p02.5_en.htm" class="la">&quot;The dropping of the atomic bomb </a>had an extremely shocking  effect on the time lines&quot;, Nostradamus says. Imagine if you will a gigantic  plane that is the purest, blackest velvet you can ever imagine. Across this  plane there are lines of neon bright light. It looks like a gigantic  emission-line spectrum in astronomy, which is a very small portion of the  entire timescape in general. Each one of these lines represents a time line, a  possible reality, or a possible future.</p>

            <p>There  are many possible futures. These lines go along neatly, nicely and orderly, and  suddenly they all run together into a central point. This is what I call  &quot;nexus&quot;. They all run together, and at the point where they all meet it looks  like a gigantic explosion - a big blast of light frozen as its most expanded  point. And instead of being able to see the nexus, you see this explosion that  has been frozen instead. <br>
              <br>
              In so many of the various  realities the world did not survive the inventing of the atomic bomb. In this  world, the scientists did not know whether or not it would set off a chain reaction and make every  atom in the world explode, thus destroying the world. That was one of their  fears. Well, in alternate realities that did indeed happen because of the way  these alternate realities were structured. As you know, when it comes to a  point where a problem can go one way or the other, it actually goes both ways,  but only one way is expressed in your reality. The other way is expressed in  another reality.</p>

We should not let the vicissitudes  of time affect us too drastically since time is really not as rigid as we think  it is. Time is actually very flexible. Once  you release that, you get into the pure essence of the vibration, and it&rsquo;s like  fine-tuning a particular channel. He has the  ability to release time and space and see many parallel times happening at  once. It&rsquo;s like the cubicles of a hive. </p></td>
