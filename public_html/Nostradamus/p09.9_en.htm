To have no potable water <em>&ndash; &laquo;<span class="michel">to die of thirst through a great deficiency</span>&raquo; - </em>is literal. You  can still die of thirst although surrounded by water. So what&rsquo;s interesting is  that this quatrain also refers to the future. It <em>has</em> already happened once and will happen again now.<br>
            The climates of Europe and Asia will change but not  drastically. Some areas will become colder, but some will become more  temperate. Russia will not be as cold as it was, but by far, the better weather  will be in the western hemisphere.
