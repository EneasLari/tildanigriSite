          <td><p>&ldquo;Initially&rdquo;, Nostradamus  continues, &ldquo;I concentrate with the help of a few breaths and visualize a candle  flame in my mind. Quite suddenly it explodes, floods with light and that&rsquo;s how<br>
            I see the future events within it. Every time I communicate through  a vehicle I tell him to mentally picture the mirror because that helps to open  up the path. <br>
            <br>
            The vehicle kept seeing a strange glass or mirror. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to give  the measurements, too&rdquo;, she said. &ldquo;I see an oval, I&rsquo;d say about fourteen inches  long and about &hellip; four and a half, five inches wide. An oval of &hellip; I want to call  it &ldquo;glass,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not sure. It&rsquo;s not glass, it&rsquo;s obsidian. It&rsquo;s like a  volcanic stone, but it&rsquo;s so shiny it&rsquo;s almost glass.          </p></td>

            <p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a  surface between two dimensions. One side of the glass is on our dimension and  that side looks kind of milky white. And when you flip it over and see the  other side, which is connected with the other dimension, you see nothing, a  void, black. Maybe occasionally a little bit of shimmer if the light hits it  just right. But there&rsquo;s just nothing there because the other side of this glass  is not in this dimension. Like a window or a doorway of something.</p>

            His forehead is kind of straight, and his hair goes back from his  forehead. He has a beard and a mustache that is flowing and real pretty. And he  has piercing eyes. I seem to associate him with some sort of laboratory, things  cluttered up, instruments, junk<br>
            like that.</p></td>

            <p>But the main thing  that fascinates me personally is the concept of this glass oval of whatever it  is with two dimensions. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of technology or knowledge would  produce such a thing, but it&rsquo;s interesting to try to conceive the civilization  that would have instruments like that&rdquo;.</p>
