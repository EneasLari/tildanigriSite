            for  various reasons: for political expression, for raising money to aid people  stricken with catastrophe or what-have-you. This type of music was like nothing  I had ever heard before; it is rock music. I always thought that was<br>
            a piece of  a mountain, something hard that<br>
            one would use for building a wall. But I used<br>
            the phrase <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">many stringed instruments and  cymbals all around</span>&raquo;</em> to describe the sound<br>
            of amplified music.

            in the  form of concerts. That finally culminated in the United States getting out of  that war.<br>
            As various events continue to occur
            and disasters become more  frequent, 
            the government will no longer be able

And one of the ways this will be done will be  with musicians, actors, mimes, jugglers and all manner of court entertainers,  getting together and entertaining people. The money the people toss to them  will be given to those who need the disaster relief. </p>
