            <p>This is an event in  the future. Mankind will have developed some devices to moderate the weather  and be able to have some say as to how the weather will be. The machines that  are in charge in these computations and calculations will become too clever for  their own good, for they will not have common sense. Common sense is what is  gained through the experience of living. Consequently, through the fault in  their programming, which will not be spotted until too late, they will  accidentally cause the weather to misfunction so as to cause a great deal of  damage through unseasonal ice and hail.</p>

As a result, these computers, while trying to overcome  the natural forces that are trying to get things back in balance, will blow a  fuse, so to speak, and become damaged beyond use. <br>

            <p>I knew that the translators  couldn&rsquo;t understand this quatrain at all so I wrote it down fairly clearly.  They were not thinking of machines at all. They thought because I am a doctor  that this was referring to something medical, like a petrified embryo removed  from a woman&rsquo;s womb.&nbsp; That would be a  thing existing without any sense. However man&rsquo;s devices such as computers and  such have no senses either. </p>

So severe that the crust  will rip open all the way through the mantle and the hot lava will spew forth.  That particular earthquake will be so disastrous that it will set off  earthquakes all over wherever earthquakes happen. They will be so large and  dangerous they will be destroying things right and left. <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">St. George</span>&raquo;</em> is a clear reference to England.

But it will be perhaps previously unknown. This coincides with the time  of great geological troubles. There will be earthquakes and volcanoes erupting,  and this will mess up the weather systems so there will be great famine and  drought. This will causes social upheaval in unexpected places.

The  social upheaval caused by this will assist the Anti-Christ in gaining power in  certain areas of the world. It will be one of the contributing factors of  things being weakened and ready for the takeover by the Anti-Christ. It will be  a very fiery time, very dry and very hot and fiery astrologically.

One of the signs that the Anti-Christ was coming would be a whole year without  a rainbow. This sounded symbolic rather than actual. There would be droughts  with little rain until this dramatic year without a rainbow, indicating extreme  dryness.

This religious fervor affects the  Anti-Christ&rsquo;s side of things, too. It helps him to come into power for he has a  very guileful tongue.

            <p>One of the largest  hurricanes of the century is going to hit Cape Canaveral also known as Cape  Kennedy. The wind will be so high with so much flooding that there&rsquo;ll be a  great deal of damage to repair at NASA when the storm is over. Much of the  equipment used with rocket launches and such is going to be damaged and bent up and blown around. <br>

              Note: Hieron was a character in Greek mythology, a  master shipbuilder, used in the quatrain to represent the space vehicles and  such. The symbol of Olympus represents the great amount of flooding, to Olympic  proportions, so to speak.</em></p>

            <p>The city <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">surrounded by a swamp of crystal</span>&raquo;</em> refers to Los Angeles. The swamp of crystal refers to all buildings of glass with  the great many windows. One gets lost in a swamp and one can get lost in these  cities. Due to a shift in the wind patterns, a very hot, dry wind will blow and  cause great drought and forest fires; it will be unprecedented. In south  America, a similar phenomenon is called &laquo;<span class="michel">El Nino</span>&raquo; but this will be ten times  worse than any they&rsquo;ve had before. It will happen in the spring when they get  the spring rains for the crops. It will be declared a national disaster area,  and countries all over the world will send aid.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>As I have said &laquo;<em class="michel">three cities on the West Coast that form a  triangle would be hit by earthquakes</em>.&raquo; You can very easily ascertain, that  two of the points of the triangle are in the place called &quot;California.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              There  would be earthquakes in New York City too. That will be part of the more  drastic earth changes that will be taking place later. The ones in California  will happen first. They will be closer to the more natural order of things  because that place is prone to earthquakes as it is. And then the places that  should not have earthquakes will also have them. <br>

              The shift of the axis is not a gradual thing like some  would say. It happens suddenly. And when it happens it could be very  catastrophic.            </p>

            <p>In the part of the earth the Anti-Christ is in (Middle  East), there will be less damage sustained than in other parts of the earth.  These changes will affect his land but they won&rsquo;t devastate it like some lands  will be. So he&rsquo;ll be able to turn this to his advantage. At a little later time  when other countries are still trying to recover, he offers assistance. And  once they accept assistance, it is too late for them, for he will eventually  end up stabbing them in the back.<br>
              United States will have its  problems too, but it will be in a state of strong martial law so they will  already be organized and can pull together, whereas other countries will be  under civilian law at the time of the earthquakes. After the disaster strikes,  martial law is declared to bring order to the streets and stop the looting.</p>
