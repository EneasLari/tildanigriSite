Due to the weapons he uses and the ravages of war, the  Anti-Christ knows that one way of bringing a potential enemy under control is  to threaten cultural destruction rather than just strict physical destruction.  For cultural objects have great meaning to a culture, and people will go to  great lengths to try to preserve certain places and things. His main tool will  be the use of terrorist tactics but on a larger scale. What he will do to put  Europe into its initial shock, to make it easier to take over, is that he will  start destroying the city of Rome. </p>
