                <p>While  performing my medical cures I usually use a combination of physical and mental  ways of controlling pain in operations, suppress bleeding, etc. If I put my  mind in a certain frame I can see the life energies that flow through a body.  If there&rsquo;s a point where they&rsquo;re not flowing the way they should, if you press  that place or rub it or use other types of manipulation to where they flow  freely again, many times that helps to eliminate pain.<br>
                  <br>
              The fact that I&rsquo;m  able to see the things that will happen is very helpful. I got many of the  physical techniques that I use from things I saw from future times. However,  being as strong psychically as I am, I&rsquo;m able to mentally see what is wrong so  that I would know what to treat. </p>

              <p>One thing that I do  is <em>very </em>effective: I get the patient  to help me with it. I get them in the right frame of mind as well, to where  they don&rsquo;t feel the pain. I have been conducting experiments to find out what  the mind <em>can</em> do; these studies are  both medical and metaphysical at the same time. These studies are very popular  with my students. Often at the beginning of an operation I&rsquo;ll stare into a  patient&rsquo;s eyes to get them in the proper frame of mind and I murmur to them  good things like, they&rsquo;re feeling good, that it&rsquo;s very pleasant, that they have  no reason to be afraid, and that everything is going to be okay and they&rsquo;ll be  just fine afterward, and things like that. I would build them up and help  them develop confidence in themselves as well as trust in what I was doing; to  help the psychic fields to be conducive towards both the physical and the  mental and the emotional aspects of healing. </p>

Hypnosis is a  handy tool to help lessen pain in people and I am glad that it has not been  lost through the ages. The method of hypnosis can be used to contact people  through time. There are really no limits to what can be done with the mind. <br>
                <br>
              My colleagues wonder how I&rsquo;m able  to do these things, but whenever I try to explain to them, their superstitions  get in the way and they immediately start crying &quot;witchcraf&quot;. So, I choose to be silent. And my reputation grows.  I&rsquo;m respected because I&rsquo;m educated and because my medicine &ndash; my  doctoring &ndash; works. I was  born to plain and simple parents. I have no titles. In my point in time noble people carry very real power  and people honestly believe the King to be God, because the King has absolute  power. Also, in my time the church is <em>extremely</em> powerful. And I have to be careful about  that, too. It should be obvious to anybody  that my task is vital. Else why would I have this ability that I have? I&rsquo;ve had  it all my life. I did not ask for it. God works in mysterious ways, and this is  one of his more mysterious ways, I suppose &hellip; </div></td>

                <p>I often use color as a factor in  healing. One of the things I would do to help  create the right atmosphere is that, by using a prism, I would demonstrate the colors  of light to a patient. I would demonstrate how what appears to be white light  has other colors in it. I would then point out one of the colors to them and  ask them to imagine that they were standing in a light of this color shining  down upon them. Whichever color was necessary for the desired result to help  set their psychic fields in balance.<br>

                <p>In my medicine that I  practice, I also use the normal methods of my day. I use more natural  ingredients; herbs and poultices, as opposed to chemicals, such as sulfur and  brine. <br>
                I work a lot with energy  and through the aura and the chakras. I work with energy much more than people  are aware of. I learned these methods from  my work in meditation. They came to me through my quest for knowledge.</p>

                <p>During the times when the  plagues were very bad in my land, I had success where other doctors failed. I  was able to do this by balancing the energy of the aura. I do this many times  with the energy of my own aura, and also with movement. To discover where the  block is, it either needs to be opened or closed. And this is done through the  auric field with either a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion of the hand. I physically touch the chakras and also  physically scan them with my hands. If there is too great an influx of energy  coming into an energy center, a counter-clockwise motion of my hand above the  area will diminish the opening. I find the balance or put the body into  harmony. When the body is in harmony, it heals itself.&nbsp; </p>
