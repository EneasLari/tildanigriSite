The only way these space colonies will be able to function is for men  and women to work together harmoniously, and be rid of their narrow minded,  bigoted and chauvinistic attitudes about sex roles. The birth of Androgyn  symbolizes that men and women will be able to do what is best suited for them  without worrying whether or not it&rsquo;s suitable for someone of their sex. This  type of change will also affect the people left on Earth.</p></td>

When the time of peace  comes this lack will be made up. For in early days the female aspect of the  deity was worshipped. The masculine aspect was also worshipped, but as being  subordinate to the female aspect of deity. Then the patriarchal era came into  being. What society will need to come to terms with and be able to handle is  that deity is both male and female, neither male or female. They need to be  able to deal with all these aspects of deity in a balanced way, in order to  develop a more balanced universal view.</p></td>
