The only way people will survive will  be by melting the ice from the poles or by extracting pure water from the sea.  Then in an attempt to balance this out, the scales will swing in the other  direction and there is a rainbow every day, causing copious rains and a lot of  floods &ndash; <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">the dry Earth will grow more  parched, and there will be great floods</span>&raquo;.</em></p></td>

            <p>The time element is  not necessarily 40 years, however. I was using that as a concept for 40 cycles.  Somehow mankind will do something to cause the environment of the Earth to get  out of balance, out of kilter, so as to trigger an ice age. The sort where the  water is being captured in the ice at the poles so there&rsquo;s no water for rain  for a period of time. Then it will swing the other way when the ice age ends  and there&rsquo;s too much water everywhere. Because the poles will be melting at a  copious rate and there will be a lot of rain and floods and the sea levels will  rise again. This is a natural part of the history of Earth. It happened in the  past and it will happen again in the future. And once again, as it was the last  time, this ice age will cause this civilization to fall. It will erase all  traces of this civilization so that another civilization will have to rise  afterward, the way it did this time. <br>
              These cycles could be  cycles of millenniums.</p>

In previous quatrains I have translated, I have  referred to an event where man overcomes the balance of the Earth and causes  great changes in the climate and the seasons, causing much hardship and famine.  As a result of this, many lands that are now major agricultural lands producing  a lot of grain and food for much of the world will be frozen and will not grow  food any longer. And the people who live there, who have grown food there will  leave these lands like rats leaving a sinking ship. They&rsquo;ll be running to lands  that can still be lived in and can still grow food. There&rsquo;ll be a lot of  dissension and fighting as the lands get more crowded and each tries to push  the other out. As a result of the panic there&rsquo;ll be several stupid decisions  made. The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">kingdoms</span></em>&raquo; refer to areas  of power rather than areas of land.</p></td>

The first six of these have been experienced  and fulfilled, and we&rsquo;re in the seventh portion now which has to do with man  and his doings. As soon as <em>&laquo;</em><span class="michel"><em>the year of the great seventh number accomplished</em></span><em>&raquo;,</em> at the<strong> </strong>end of this age will be the end of the  age of mankind. Although the Earth will continue to exist for a few ages after  that, man will have served his purpose and accomplished what he needed to do  here on Earth. He will be elsewhere instead, and the wheel of karma will no  longer send men to Earth but to other locations. By the <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">when  the dead will come out of their graves</span>&raquo;</em> I&rsquo;m referring to the transfer of men&rsquo;s souls elsewhere  from this planet. </p><p align="justify"><br>

            <p>This is not going to  happen soon. When dealing with karmic matters, one has to take into effect the  great wheel of the universe and the slowness with which it moves. Between now  and then, civilization will have fallen down and been rebuilt several times.  Some of the traditions and conventions of the former civilizations will survive  and be passed down, but each time this happens they will be perverted a little  bit more. The games of slaughter of that time - <em>&laquo;</em><span class="michel"><em>it will appear at the time of the  games of slaughter</em></span><em>&raquo;</em><strong> - </strong>stem directly from  the Olympic games of your time. This regular meeting every four years of all  nations to perform these sports events will gradually -through the succession  of civilizations with intervening periods of savagery - be perverted into  something resembling the gladiatorial games of ancient Rome. It&rsquo;s just simply  another natural example of the circle of time. The games started out in  athletic form in ancient Greece, became perverted to violence in Rome, and then  when the games were reinstated it was of sports orientation again.</p>

            <p>There will be a base  established on the moon. It will be a major center of communication and  scientific research. During this time this base&rsquo;s major purpose will be for  developing &ndash; I&rsquo;m calling them <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">freestanding  space stations</span>&raquo;,</em> meaning independent of everything and everybody else. They  have various shapes: some are cylindrical, some are conical and some spherical.  All of them have large solar sails attached to provide them with the energy  they need. The moon base will be developing and building these space stations.  That&rsquo;s where the main central work for the trade and the industries will be, so  the moon will not have such a major place in the scheme of things anymore. It  will remain the nexus of communications but the scientific research and the  industry and such will move out to the space stations. And Earth will enter a  major period of prosperity and growth because there will be room to grow and  enough for everybody. Things will be basically peaceful if Earth manages to  avoid certain bad decisions that could lead to war, and if Earth updates her  civil laws so there won&rsquo;t be so much grass-roots unrest. </p>
