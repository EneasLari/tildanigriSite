          <td><p>This refers to the  positions of the planets in regards to the astrological signs. The influence of  Venus, that is, of love and understanding, will be temporarily obscured due to  other considerations, particularly the force of Mars, that is, of war. <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">The engraved wand</span>&raquo; </em>represents a symbol  of power and weapons. It has to do with an advanced technology that is  currently being developed but you are not aware of it.<br>
            <br>
          These will happen  during the times of troubles, at a point when Venus and Jupiter are in  Sagittarius and with Venus being partially obscured by Neptune. This pinpoints  the time for the onset of the major war that will cause destruction and famine  and the plagues I&rsquo;ve mentioned in several other quatrains.          </p></td>

Neptune, as we describe it in esoteric  astrology, is the higher octave of Venus. Meaning that on one side it&rsquo;s the  spiritual love of the universe, but on the other side Neptune can be the great  sensualist or deceiver or the great waster of time.</em>          </p></td>

          <td><p>As I&rsquo;ve already said, the ray of hope is there and my purpose for communicating with  these quatrains is to try to at least alter, if not prevent, the worst aspects  of these events from coming up. Whether the events are altered or not, even if  the very worst that can happen happens, there will still be a great spiritual  rebirth throughout the entire world. And during the time of troubles, people  individually will have opportunities to get in touch with themselves and  realize that the materialistic values were false. After the time of troubles  when people start communicating with each other again, they will find out that  other people realize this also.          </p></td>

          <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">
            <p>This will cause a  great rebirth of philosophy and a great blending of the best aspects of eastern  and western religions. It will result in a worldwide movement of philosophical  thought that is in accord with what people know and feel to be true. This will  bring about the best aspects of the Age of Aquarius. If people could realize  this ahead of time and hold on to this ray of hope, then they could alleviate  some of the worst aspects of this time of troubles that is coming. But I fear  it may be unlikely that this could happen in any widespread form, due to the  materialistic values held by the majority of the populace. </p>
