Things the church had declared people should not read for it would be  threatening to their faith. He will be sure that these things are distributed  about. It will cause much dissension with the church. Theologians and priests  and students will turn one against the other, each with their own theories and  interpretations concerning this new information. And all will be confusion.  That way the Catholic Church will no longer pose the obstacle that it did  before for this man and his plans.</p>
