The only clear idea that comes through is that this  organic computer will be essential in the running of the space colonies. I  guess you automatically think if something is organic it has to be nurtured and  fed and &hellip; yes, the building blocks of this computer have to be grown and  developed in the laboratory. Certain types of liquids with certain chemical  building blocks in them will be used, causing this computer to grow and develop  along certain biological formations. Almost like chains of protein, but done in  such a way so it can be integrated into certain computer circuits.&nbsp; </p><p align="justify"><br>

            <p>If something is organic it could die, so to speak. However, the way  this is developed through this man&rsquo;s genius, it is self-renewing like the cells  of your body. Some of the organic parts will eventually wear out and get old.  But meanwhile it will have replicated itself, so there will be organic parts  sloughing off form this device but there won&rsquo;t be any loss of knowledge because  it will be continually self-renewing. Applications of this computer will be  applied wider and wider to where it would totally alter the technology of  mankind.</p>

However, a discovery in 1991 put the concept within the realm of plausibility.  The problem with traditional computer chips, the microscopic devices that make  computers work, is that there is a limit to how small they can be made. A group  of researchers at Syracuse University reported they are now able to store and  retrieve information from a tiny block made of the protein </em>&laquo;<em>bacteriorhydapsin.&raquo;</em><br>

They say that six small cubes of this material,  each a mere one-centimeter to side, could store the entire Library of Congress.  It will probably be many years before the computer industry will be able to put  this discovery to use, but it definitely is organic if it is derived from  bacteria. This could be the substance, or something similar and equally  fantastic, used in the computers during the time of the Great Genius.)<br>

              <p>I envision that this will be something  that will happen in the 21st century, perhaps the 22nd.  Even though it seems very fantastic to you, it will not be as far in the future  as one would think. Because of this man&rsquo;s genius he will speed up the process  immensely in developing things that seem very fantastic to you now.</p>
