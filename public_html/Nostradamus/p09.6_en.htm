          <td><p>Nothing will really look the same any more. I see a  level of the Earth with Earth below it, and when the Earth shifts, only the top  level moves northward and the level underneath doesn&rsquo;t. That causes areas to  crack open. (He proceeded to give an analogy). Try to see the United States on  a table made out of hardpacked dirt that&rsquo;s a foot thick, and under that is more  dirt that was joined together at one time. Now when the poles shift, this upper  foot is going to move northwards, and it&rsquo;s not going to take the lower portion  with it. It will separate - Remember this is an analogy, I don&rsquo;t know how many <em>thousands</em> of feet deep it is. &ndash; Only the  upper part moves and becomes disjointed from the bottom part. Then the upper  foot of dirt is not substantial enough to hold together, so it will split and  crack like parched earth. As it shifts northward it will disturb the waters  which will cause further splitting, cracking, and flooding. The waters will  move in from the north, and the seas above Canada and Alaska will flood the  upper part of the North American continent, and then a <em>greater</em> part. Below it,<strong> the  Great Lakes</strong> will flood downward. <br>
And on either side of the United States the upper  parts of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans will flood downward. All of this water  will cover a great portion of the United States, which will break off and  separate because of the cracks. By the time the flooding subsides, it&rsquo;s hit the  southern oceans below the United States, and it starts all over again. So a  great deal of water will seemingly move from the north downward.<br>
We tried to distinguish which states would be left  above water. The higher mountainous areas would survive because of their  elevations. Other areas did not seem to follow such simple rules. A large land  segment would be located in the interior of the United States, composed of  parts of <strong>Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,  Nebraska</strong>, etc. But some of this area did not have a very high elevation. We  couldn&rsquo;t understand why the rising waters of the Great Lakes, the Mississippi  River, and water coming down from Canada wouldn&rsquo;t cover this area also.<br>
<strong>The poles</strong> will melt, but the thicker areas will not break up as  easily as the areas of land. The <strong>North  pole</strong> is going to shift northwards, back about a quarter down on the other  side, closer to Russia and Siberia. The <strong>South  pole</strong> will move upward, possibly into southern South America. If you could  visualize the United States as it lies now, the continent will turn northward  and slightly twist to the right.<br>
Imagine the world being round like a ball. The North  Pole is at the top, and when this plate of the United States shifts northwards,  what&rsquo;s underneath shifts, too. But instead of following the curvature of the  ball, it will push outward once it gets past the roundest point of the planet.  Do you understand what I mean? It&rsquo;s going to start shifting northward and when  it hits an area that confines it, it has no place to go. When that happens it&rsquo;s  going to come out away from the planet. That&rsquo;s what will happen to the area we  call the <strong>Midwest</strong>. It will involve  Arkansas and the states above it. Kansas and <strong>Nebraska</strong>,<strong> </strong>which we think  of as plains states, are going to be pushed outward, too.<br>
The pushing up of that land will not happen from  directly under the United States. <br>
<strong>The United States  will be broken up into six or seven island-type masses</strong>. The largest portion was again reported to be in the  middle of the country. The East and West Coasts were mostly inundated, and most  of the upper area around the Great Lakes and all of the southern area was gone.<br>
Some large cities such as <strong>Seattle</strong> and <strong>Denver</strong> will  be left. Cities will develop on the middle land mass. I don&rsquo;t see anything  there <em>now</em> that we would call a major  city, since <strong>St. Louis</strong> and <strong>Kansas City</strong> will be gone. The Midwest  has smaller cities and a lot of undeveloped farm land. <br>
One city in that area which will have the most  commerce or people will be <strong>Harrison</strong>,  Arkansas. There will be another city just south of it on the east side of that  landmass that will become a big port and a trading center. It might even be -  no, it&rsquo;s not far south as <strong>Little Rock</strong>. <br>
Many of the small towns will enlarge, particularly on what  will then be coastline because the remaining people will go to those areas to  find work. Most of the transportation will be by water at that time. They won&rsquo;t  be lengthy trips by water, but ships or very large boats will be utilized to  carry things from one land mass to another, like we now do by rail or truck. So  there will be jobs along the coastline and people will gravitate toward those  areas.</p>
They  will be port cities, but none of them will ever again be as large as the cities  you have now &ndash; like Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago; the populations will be  more evenly spaced.</td>

          <td><p>By<em> &laquo;<span class="michel">the eye of  the sea</span>&raquo;</em> I mean a place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Lima, Peru.  This environmental feature <em>has been</em> affected by mankind and it wasn&rsquo;t present in my time period. It looks like the  eye of a hurricane. It causes weather patterns to fluctuate in the United  States and it has been controlled by man. It&rsquo;s been happening since 1945. The  reason why America is a great nation is because of her food supply; this is her  wealth. Russia has a hard time because of its harsh climate. of an unfriendly  country So the Soviet Union will try to strip America of its wealth by  manipulating the weather. They have planned this storm center. El Nino and  other similar weather phenomena are manufactured by man, can be predicted six  to nine months before they occur, giving governments time to plan so they can  alleviate the hardships this weather phenomenon can cause.&nbsp; <br>
            In actuality it won&rsquo;t, because the United States will  offset it using its own scientists and engineering - <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">From there will come the relief</span>&raquo;</em>. As a result, there will be  better trade and friendship between these two countries in the future. <br>
  <strong>Washington</strong> will be gone. <strong>The  seat of the government</strong> will be relocated to the far northwest: Washington  state, <strong>Oregon </strong>area. Government as  you know it will not exist anymore. Means of communication will be so advanced  by that time that, although <em>physical</em> things will be lost, the knowledge won&rsquo;t be lost. Paper work, computers, disks,  and whatever, <em>may</em> be physically lost,  but not lot of knowledge will be lost because it is so easily accessible at  that time.<br>
          You will not have a President in the same way you do  now. After the shift there will be more of a council or a board of directors.  You may have that even before the axis shift. You won&rsquo;t be ruled by <em>a</em> President any longer. The sharing of  knowledge and decision-making between a group of people of high integrity and  knowledge will serve your needs better. I don&rsquo;t see anything like a House of  Representatives or Senate at that time. Those groups are too <em>big</em> to be effective, and on the other  hand, <em>one</em> President is too <em>small</em>. You will have settled in, or <em>will</em> then settle in to a council group  of a few people that will help guide what goes on in the country.</p></td>
