                <p>This quatrain refers to the organization run by the  one I have referred to as &laquo;Ogmios&raquo;. This organization will survive through the  worst of the troubled times and serve as a basis of future governments after  the Anti-Christ had been brought down. The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">law  and empire raised by the Sun</span>&raquo; </em>means that the glory and the positive nature  of the sun will be behind Ogmios and help him endure the worst. </p>

            <p>What&rsquo;s really interesting is that <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Saturn will dominate Jupiter</span>&raquo;</em> is in both of their horoscopes.  Saturn, the co-ruler of the sign of Aquarius, shows up in the Anti-Christ&rsquo;s  horoscope. Venus is in Aquarius in the Anti-Christ&rsquo;s horoscope and in Scorpio  in Ogmios&rsquo;. The Venus aspects between these two are square to each other which  means they have a sense of conflict of purpose. Venus in Scorpio is much more  emotional and sensitive than Venus in the sign of Aquarius, which is cool and  detached. The Anti-Christ will lack compassion and an understanding of other  people, whereas Venus in the seventh house in Ogmios&rsquo; chart shows that he&rsquo;s a  much more loving person, even though he might not have personal relationships.  He has become spiritually loving to all people. Anytime we have Venus in  Scorpio, it goes through a transformation process. </p>

            <p><em>&laquo;<span class="michel">The Sun will  endure the worst</span>&raquo; </em>indicates that  these are not the best placements for the sun in traditional astrology.The sun is in fall in the sign of  Aquarius means &ndash; I usually compare it to the time of the year &ndash; it&rsquo;s like the  cool, snowy days of January and February. This is when the sun is making its  return from the southern latitudes, and that&rsquo;s why it was considered the Fall.  When the sun is in Libra we have equal days and nights again.</p>

            <p>Because the night gets stronger during the month of Libra,  and Ogmios&rsquo; sun is in the sign of Libra, this means the night is descending. In  the Anti-Christ&rsquo;s horoscope the sun is in Aquarius, which is in Fall. This  means the sun has moved away and is slowly returning again. These are the  darkest times of the year for the sun energy.</p>

            <p><em>&laquo;<span class="michel">The kingdom and  law raised under Venus</span>&raquo;: </em>Venusin Aquarius shows he&rsquo;s going to come  across as a very strong humanitarian as he helps the world. He might even use  something similar to the World Peace Movement. The Libra planets that show up  in Ogmios&rsquo; chart are in good aspect to the Anti-Christ&rsquo;s which shows they are  compatible. So Ogmios might start out as a follower of the Anti-Christ, but  when he sees the Anti-Christ&rsquo;s inhumanity, he will separate from him. In other  words, Ogmios will believe that this man is trying to make humanity more  prosperous, but he will be disillusioned when he sees him in his true light.  His aspects show that in the beginning Ogmios doesn&rsquo;t want to see himself as a  leader. He is being led into something he&rsquo;s unsure of.</p>

            <p>He has strong humanitarian principles with his north  node in the sign of Aquarius. His spiritual destiny is represented by the north  node, showing that he has grown as a soul in previous lifetimes, and now it&rsquo;s  time for him to help mankind. His underground organization is ruled by Scorpio  in the seventh house, so he will have a network of partners, friends and key  contacts who will be hidden. Pluto in the fourth house shows that his base of  operations will be close to where he was born.</p>
