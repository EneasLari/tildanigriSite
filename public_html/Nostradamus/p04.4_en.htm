            <p>I know that the  Anti-Christ is in the Middle East somewhere. I can&rsquo;t spot him exactly because  of all the violence and the turmoil in that part of the world which cloud my  vision somewhat. At the present time (early April 1987), I think he is in  Egypt; he is a young man at a very crucial time in his life. Any strong  impressions he gets at this time will have an effect on his future lifepath.</p>

                <p>I see an image now in the mirror: I see a very  handsome young man, with strong features, in his mid-twenties. He&rsquo;s dressed in  a business suit right now and he seems to be discussing things with seven Arab  leaders in Egypt. They&rsquo;re sitting on low cushions around a huge brass table or  brass tray. There are all types of coffee, a silver and gold coffee service,  and they&rsquo;re eating finger foods. There is a very big fat Arab man there, and  he&rsquo;s very jovial. He&rsquo;s laughing and he says, &quot;Oh, we&rsquo;ll have them Americans  eating out of our hands soon enough.&quot;</p>

His skin and his features are flawless. He&rsquo;s kind  of tall but well proportioned. He&rsquo;s impeccably dressed and on his finger he has  a magnificent stone. It&rsquo;s interesting because it&rsquo;s a big diamond but it&rsquo;s set  in a black stone which is set in a gold ring. And he wears it on his <em>middle</em> finger which is strange place to  wear a ring.</p></td>

It&rsquo;s like a fez but it isn&rsquo;t a fez. They&rsquo;re all getting up now  they&rsquo;re bowing down to Mecca doing absolutions to Allah. They&rsquo;re discussing the  future of this man, giving him support and money. They&rsquo;re telling him to go to  Switzerland to draw money from a bank account there and use this money &hellip; it  will take him into Syria, Iraq, and Iran. But he cannot go to Iran yet, because  he will run into difficulties with the ruler of that country. (This was before Ayatollah  Khomeni died). They&rsquo;re planning a counter-revolution in the Islamic world. That  is the purpose of this meeting. And it&rsquo;s taking place ... <em>now</em>. </p>

He has also told his nephew that  his parents were dead and that they had been killed in the Egyptian war. In  fact his father and mother were murdered. The uncle had hired assassins because  he wanted the boy for himself. He was a young  boy of five or six when that took place.
