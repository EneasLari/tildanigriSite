            <p>This quatrain applies to  the Kennedys. I knew they would be important men in your time period - the  Kennedys are definitely considered among them, but their power was meant to  wane. <br>
              <br>
              The Kennedys are the  reincarnation of the Roman Gracchus brothers. In  my initial searchings I didn&rsquo;t know if I  might believe in reincarnation. For a long time it was  very hard for me to accept it. But now that I see the transmigration of souls  from the mirror, I can understand its process.</p>

            <p>I am again referring to  ancient Roman history. Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, called the Gracchi, were  two brothers who attempted to institute political and social reforms in Rome  during the second century B.C.E. There are several parallels between the lives  of these brothers and the lives of the Kennedy brothers.</p>

            <p>Most notable was their  attempt to pass legislation that would benefit the average person. They were faced  with problems such as, a crisis in military manpower, and a poor and unemployed  rabble in Rome. Tiberius was killed during a riot when he attempted to run for  a second year as tribune, an act that was considered unconstitutional. His  brother, Gaius, tried to avenge his brother&rsquo;s murder by entering politics and  proceeding with his brother&rsquo;s plans. Gaius was considered to be more of a  rabble rouser where his brother had been more dignified. During his career  Gaius became so popular that he was declared the uncrowned king of Rome. A few  years into his popularity he made the fatal mistake of submitting a very  unpopular piece of legislation. Again, a riot broke out, and Gaius committed  suicide while being pursued through the streets of Rome by a senatorial posse.  Perhaps he did it to escape the same fate as his brother. Two thousand of his  followers were executed after his death. The time period of the Gracchi is  called the Roman Revolution. <br>
              <br>
              Their story is full of  similarities. </p>
