            <p>In this quatrain I&rsquo;m referring to  a period of time in which there is a war. An event happens near the end of this  war, when <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Saturn</span>&raquo;</em> is in retrograde,  to help narrow down the time involved. In this war, as in all wars, there are  great advances done in research of science, both weapons research and things  like that. In this war the scientists are researching how to warp and alter  time to help change some events, to swing the war over to their advantage. And  they fail yet again.</p>

          <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">
            <p>As a result of this second  failure, the entire complex is destroyed in a large catastrophe. That is <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">the eye being plucked out by a goshawk</span>&raquo;.</em> Because they are dealing with powers they don&rsquo;t know how to control and it rips  them apart. The people who are  not there assume that they were hit by a missile of some sort because of the  great destruction. But what happened was that the vortexes of energy they are  trying to deal with were not fine tuned enough to work with and they got out of  control. Those words <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Narbonne</span>&raquo;</em> (pronounced : Nar-bone) and <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Brodde</span>&raquo;</em> (pronounced: Broad-da) are referring to the nation and the place. It seems to  me that it involves England and Northern Europe. But what I tuned in on was  that the government involved is most devious and it has false names for things. <br>
              <br>
              The catastrophe will  be very localized and will have some strange side-effects in the dimension of  time in the general area there. It will eventually have far-reaching effects  because the government was counting on that line of research to give it an edge  in this war. And some of that edge is taken away and it will end up affecting  the outcome of that war.</p>
