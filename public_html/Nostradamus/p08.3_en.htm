                <p>Ogmios&rsquo; extraction is from eastern Europe. His name  will sound very strange to French ears. The name Ogmios is a symbolic reference  to Celtic mythology. Ogmios was the Celtic equivalent of the legendary  Hercules. He is supposed to represent the nemesis of the Anti-Christ. It is  through his efforts as a leader of the underground movement that the people  rise to resist the Anti-Christ. <br>
                  His birthdate is October  17, 1952.<br>
                  The <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">fearful  thunderbolt</span>&raquo;</em> refers to nuclear weapons. <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">Of  a name never held by a French king</span>&raquo;</em> refers to the underground leader who  will rise to a position of leadership over all of France during the time of troubles.  </p>

            <p>When I say <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">the  blood will be split in front of the people</span>&raquo;</em>, that refers to leaders being  assassinated. <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">But for a long time it  will not be heard</span>&raquo;,</em> refers to the fact that some of the deposed leaders&rsquo;  struggles for power will occur from within. It will be a long time before the  whole story is revealed. <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">The blood that  will not go far from the high heavens</span>&raquo;</em> represents the leaders. You must  remember that in my time kings are ordained by God, and therefore are  considered to be just one step away from God. This event will be closer to the  heavens than the everyday things that happen to people.</p>

            <p>Any time a great tyrant rises up it&rsquo;s a matter of  cosmic balance that a great hero rise up to balance this. This leader will  probably rise from the underground movement somewhere in central Europe and  will be generally acclaimed and acknowledged by many countries that are not  under the rule of the Anti-Christ, but that are struggling against him.<br>
              I suppose he&rsquo;s a priest now, because he has priest&rsquo;s  vestments on, but he&rsquo;s quite dissatisfied with the church. It doesn&rsquo;t look like  he&rsquo;s going to be with the church much longer. And it looks like he&rsquo;s in the  city of Prague, Czechoslovakia. </p>

            <p>He&rsquo;s kind of short and stocky, but he has a kind face.  He resembles Pope John XXIII. He&rsquo;s built like him but much nicer looking, and  he has much kinder eyes. He has good, full and thick Slavic features. He has a  smiling, happy-go-lucky type of face, but he&rsquo;s very serious and determined to  help. He&rsquo;s a very intelligent man, and he knows how to worm his way around  things. He&rsquo;s a charmer, and he means well. He doesn&rsquo;t have one negative thought  or attitude toward others; In fact, he&rsquo;d sacrifice anything for other people. I  don&rsquo;t think he is going to be a priest forever. He has the faith and good  intentions, but he doesn&rsquo;t have the negativity that most religious carry. He&rsquo;s  a devoted world server. </p>
