He is innocent and  did not know anything about it. So, from that perspective, he is a good  candidate for pope manipulations.  John Paul II is a good man indeed, a loving kind energy. That part about him  fearing for <em>&laquo;<span class="michel">his guide</span>&raquo;</em> the night  that he <em>is</em> killed certainly agrees  with his personality and heart vibration. He doesn&rsquo;t associate with these  uncomfortable religious figures. </p></td>

            <p>The present pope is a  good man and he honestly is striving for world peace. However, he is not in  touch with his spiritual center the way he should be for this position. But he  is desirous enough of world peace, so that &ndash; unbeknownst to the world in  general - he is working against some established power parties within the Roman  church. So a point will come at which those in the Roman church who want to  hold on to their wealth and power will advise the Pope &ndash; they will misadvise the Pope - so that he will be  placed in a situation that is dangerous to him, but he will not be aware of the  danger. Due to this assassination of the present pope there will be a lot of  unrest and rioting and such in Rome.</p>
