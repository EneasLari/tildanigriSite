Russia  will be his first major Asian conquest and he will not do it through force but  through guile, through &laquo;<em class="michel">the limberness of  his tongue</em>&raquo;. He will trick the Russians so they will come under his power  and there will be nothing they can do about it. Since he comes from the Middle  East, that area will already be fairly under his power before he tackles  Russia.</p>

              Century <strong>III-34</strong> also refers to how the  Anti-Christ spends many years working silently behind the scenes consolidating  his power. Then once the structure is built, he will make his appearance in the  international arena. He will have planned so well that the countries he goes  against will be totally unprepared for the man with the golden tongue. History  repeats itself ... </p>
