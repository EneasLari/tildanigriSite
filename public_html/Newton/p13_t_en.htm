            <p>In the place of life selection, our souls preview  the life span of more than one human being within the same time cycle. When  we leave this area, most souls are inclined toward one  leading candidate presented to us for soul occupation. However, our spiritual  advisors give us ample opportunity to reflect upon all we have seen in the future  before making a final decision. This chapter is devoted to the many elements which  go into that decision. </p>

Great care must be taken in choosing just the right body to serve us in the  life to come. As I have said, guides and peer group members are part of this evaluation  process prior to, and after, we visit the place of life selection. <br>

            <p>Our teachers use relative future time in the place of  life selection to allow souls to 
          measure human usefulness for working on unfinished lesson plans. Blueprints  for 
              the next life vary in the degree of difficulty the soul-mind sets for  itself. If we have 
              just come off an easy life, making little interpersonal progress, our soul  might want 
              to choose a person in the next time cycle who will face heartache and  perhaps 
              tragedy. It is not out of the ordinary for me to see someone who has  skated through 
              an unchallenging life overloading themselves with turmoil  in the next one to catch up with their learning goals. </p>
            <p>The soul-mind is far from infallible as it works  in conjunction with a biological brain. Regardless of our soul  level, being human means we will all make mistakes and have the  necessity of engaging in midcourse corrections during our lives. This will  be true with any body we select. </p>

Despite the  fact that our souls know in advance what they are going to look like, a national  survey in the United States  indicated 90 percent of both males and females were dissatisfied with the  physical characteristics of their bodies. This is the power of  conscious amnesia. Much unhappiness is created by society stereotyping an ideal  appearance. Yet, this too is part of a soul's lesson plan. </p>

As souls, we choose our bodies  for a reason. Living in a damaged body does not necessarily have to involve a karmic  debt we are paying off because of past life responsibility for an injury to someone  else. As my next case will demonstrate, when a soul is inside a damaged body,  this choice can involve a learning path to another type of lesson. <br>

              healthy bodies and minds. This knowledge must come through  self-discovery. The 
              case histories of my clients convince me that the effort necessary to  overcome a body 
              impediment does accelerate advancement. Those of us whom society deems  less-than-perfect�suffer�discrimination which  makes� the� burden�  even� heavier.

              Case 26 was a tall, well-proportioned woman who  enjoyed participating in sports despite being bothered all her  life with recurring leg pains. During her preliminary interview, I  learned the pain was a dull ache in both legs, about midway down the thighbones.  Over a period of years she had been to a number of doctors who could find  no medical evidence of anything wrong with her legs. Clearly, she was worn down  and willing to try anything for relief. </p>
            When �I�  heard� the� doctors�  had� concluded� her�  discomfort� was� probably psychosomatic, I suspected the  origin of this woman's pain might lie in a past life. Before going to the source of  her problem, I decided to take my client through a couple of past lives to  ascertain her motivations for body choices. When I asked her to tell me about a life in  which she was the happiest with a human body she told of being in the body of a Viking  called Leth around 800 AD. She said Leth was &quot;a child of nature&quot; who  traveled by the Baltic Sea route into western Russia.</div></td>

              <b>Dr. N:</b> Well, did you see a physically healthy  Ashley living happily without your soul? </p>
            <p><b>S:</b> I saw ... a grown woman ... normal legs ...  unhappiness with a man ... frustration at being  trapped in an unrewarding life ... sorrowful parents ... but easier. (voice becomes  more firm) <em>No!</em> That course would not have worked well for either of us - I was  the best soul for her. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Dr. N:</b> Were you the prime mover of the fall, once  you elected to become Ashley's soul? <br>
              <br>
              <b>S:</b> It ... was both of us ... we were one at that  moment ... she was being naughty, bouncing around in the carriage, playing with  the door handle when her mother said she must stop. Then ... I was  ready and she was ready ... </p>
            <p><b>Dr. N:</b> Just how rigid was your destiny? Once you  were Ashley's soul was there any way you could have backed out of  this entire incident in the carriage? </p>
            <p><b>S:</b>  (pause) I can tell you I had a flash just before I fell. I could have pulled  back and not fallen out. A voice inside my mind  said ... &quot;It's an opportunity, don't wait any longer, take  the fall, this is what you wanted-it's the best course of action.&quot; </p>
            <p><b>Dr.  N:</b> Was that particular moment important? <br>
              <br>
              <b>S:</b> I  didn't want Ashley to get too much older. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Dr.  N:</b> But, the pain and suffering this child went through ...? <br>
              <br>
              <b>S:</b> It was horrible. The agony of those first five  weeks was beyond belief. I almost died, but I learned from enduring  it all and I now see the memories of Leth's capacity for  managing pain helped me. <br>
              <br>

            <p>During my client's reliving of the street scene  which broke her legs, I initiated desensitization measures. At the  close of our session together, I then deprogrammed her  generational memory of leg pain entirely.

              <br>
              The two past lives I have represented in this  case were largely devoted to physical choices for soul  actualization in two quite different environments. Souls search for self-expression by developing different aspects of  their character. Regardless of what physical or mental tools are used through the use of  many bodies,  the laws of karma will prevail. If the soul chooses one extreme, somewhere down the line this will be  counterbalanced by an opposite choice to even-out development.� The physical lives� of�  Leth� and� Ashley are�  examples of� karmic compensation. The Hindus  believe a rich man sooner or later must become a beggar for his soul to develop  adequately.</p>

            <p>While souls carefully consider the physical  attributes of an Earth body in a variety of cultural  settings, they give much more attention to the psychological aspects of human  life. This decision is the most vital part of the entire selection process for  the soul. Before entering the place of life selection, it is to a soul's  advantage to ponder the factors of heredity and environment which  affect how a biological life form will function. I  have heard that a soul's spiritual energy has a fluctuating influence on whether  the temperament of its human host will be extroverted or introverted, rationalistic  or idealistic, emotionally or analytically dominated. Because of such variables,  souls need to reflect in advance on the types of bodies which will serve them  best in the life to come. </p>

            this responsibility more seriously than others. Yet, a soul in the  prelife selection 
            phase can reflect only so much on how they would fit into a specific  body. When 
            souls are called to the place of life selection the guesswork is over.  Now they must 
            match their spiritual identity against a mortal being. Why one soul  joined, for 
            psychological reasons, with two human beings thousands of years apart is  the basis
