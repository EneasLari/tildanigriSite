          <td><div align="justify">Since encountering friendly spirits who meet us after death is so important, how do we recognize them? I find a general consensus of opinion among subjects in hypnosis about how souls look to each other in the spirit world. A soul may appear as a mass of energy, but apparently it is also possible for non-organic soul energy to display human characteristics. Souls often use their capacity to project former life forms when communicating with each other. Projecting a human life form is only one of an incalculable number of appearances which can be assumed by souls from their basic energy substance. Later on, in Chapter Six, I will discuss another feature of soul identity - the possession of a particular color aura. </div></td>

            soulmates are not the same. If a former relative or close friend appears  to the 
            incoming soul, their regular guide might be absent from the scene. I find that 
            usually guides are somewhere in close proximity, monitoring the  incomer's arrival 
            in their own way. The soul in my next case has just come through the  spiritual <br>
            gateway and is met by an advanced entity who obviously has had close  connections

            <p>Case 8 shows the very close relationships people  have with their spiritual guides. Many guides have strange sounding  names, while others are rather conventional. I find it  interesting that the old-fashioned religious term of having a &quot;guardian  angel&quot; is now used metaphysically to denote an empathetic  spirit. To be honest, this is a term I�  once� denigrated� as�  being� foolishly� loaded�  with� wishful� thinking�  and representing an out-dated mythology at odds with the modern world. I  don't have that belief anymore about guardian angels. </p>
          I am  repeatedly told that the soul itself is androgynous, and yet, in the same  breath, clients  declare sex is not an unimportant factor. I have learned all souls can and do assume male and female mental  impressions toward other entities as a form of identity preference. Cases 6 and  7 show the importance of the newly arrived soul in seeing familiar  &quot;faces&quot; identified by gender. This is also true of the next case. Another reason why I selected  Case 8 is to indicate how and why souls choose to visually appear in human form  to others in the spirit world.</div></td>

            <p>In  hypnosis,  the  analytical  conscious  mind  works  in  conjunction  with  the unconscious mind to receive and answer messages directed to our deep-seated memories. The subject in Case 9 is an electrical engineer and thus he utilized some technical descriptions to express his spiritual sensations. This client's predisposition to explain his thoughts on soul travel in technical terms was encouraged, but not dictated, by my suggestions. All subjects bring their own segments of knowledge to bear on answering my questions about the spirit world. This case used physical laws familiar to him to describe motion, whereas another person might have said souls move in this tract within a vacuum. <br>
