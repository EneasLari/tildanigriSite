Reincarnation  back to Earth could only take place during the spring equinox  through the Gemini exit in their night sky.

            comes acceptance in varying degrees depending upon the soul. Some  subjects look at 
            these surroundings with continued amazement while others are more  matter-of-fact 
            in reporting to me what they see. Much depends upon their respective maturity  and 
            recent life experiences. The most common type of reaction I hear is a  relieved sigh

If we exclude the rare cases of  highly disturbed spirits who fight to stay connected with their dead bodies, I find it is  the younger souls with fewer past lives who remain attached to Earth's environment  right after death.<br>

These invisible regions have been experienced by people over thousands of years through meditative, out-of-body observations of the mind.

              Before touching on the significance of Case 5  meeting his guide here, I want to mention this man's interpretation of the  spirit world appearing as an ice palace. Further into  the spirit world, my subjects will talk about seeing buildings and being in  furnished rooms. The state of hypnosis by itself does not create these images. Logically,  people should not be recalling such physical structures in a non-material world  unless we consider these scenes of Earth's natural environment are intended to  aid in the soul's transition and adjustment from a physical death. These sights  have individual meaning for every soul communicating with me, all of  whom are affected by their Earth experiences. </p>

              descriptions. I find that once a subject in trance continues further into the spirit

There is no question that some souls do carry the negative  baggage of a difficult past life longer than others, despite the  calming influences of the spirit world. People tend to think all souls become omniscient  at death. This is not completely true because adjustment periods vary. The  time of soul adjustment depends upon the circumstances of death, attachments of  each soul to the memories of the life just ended, and level of advancement.</p>
              <p align="justify">I frequently hear anger during age-regression when a young life ends  suddenly. Souls  reentering the spirit world under these conditions are often bewildered and confused over leaving people  they love without much warning. They are unprepared for death and some feel sad  and deprived right after leaving their bodies. </p></td>
