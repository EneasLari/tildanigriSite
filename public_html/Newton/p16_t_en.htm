            <p>The information contained in this book about the existence of souls after physical death represents the most meaningful explanation I have found in my life as to why we are here. All my years of searching to discover the purpose of life hardly prepared me for that moment when a subject in hypnosis finally opened the door to an eternal world. <br>
              <br>
              My oldest friend is a Catholic priest today. As boys walking together in the hills and 
              along the beaches of Los Angeles we had many philosophical discussions, but were 
              miles apart in our spiritual beliefs. He once told me, &quot;I think it must take courage 
              for you to be an atheist and believe in nothing beyond this life.&quot;</p>

              <p>I didn't see it that 
                way at the time, nor for many years afterward. Starting at age five, I had been sent 
                by my parents to military-type boarding schools for long periods. The feelings of 
                abandonment and loneliness were so great I believed in no higher power than 
                myself. I now realize strength was given to me in subtle ways I was unable to see. <br>
                <br>
                My friend and I still have different approaches to spirituality, but we both have 
                convictions today that order and purpose in the universe emanate from a higher 
                consciousness. <br>

          Looking back, I suppose it was no accident in my  own life that people would eventually come to me for  hypnosis - a medium of truth I could believe in - to tell me about  guides, heavenly gateways, spiritual study groups, and creation itself in a world  of souls. Even now, I sometimes feel like an intruder in the minds of those who  describe the spirit world and their place in it, but their knowledge has given  me direction.� Still,� I�  wonder why I am the messenger for the spiritual knowledge contained  in this book, when someone with less original cynicism and doubt would surely  have been much better suited. Actually, it is the people represented in these cases  who are the real messengers of hope for the future, not the reporter. </p>          </td>

They have taught me that a major aspect of our mission on  Earth as souls is to mentally survive being cut off from our real home.  While in a human body, the soul is essentially alone. A soul's relative  isolation on Earth during a temporary physical life is made more  difficult on a conscious level by thoughts that nothing exists  beyond this life. Our doubts tempt us into finding attachments  solely in a physical world we can see. The scientific knowledge that Earth  is only a grain of sand at the edge of a galactic shoreline within a vast sea  in the universe adds to our feelings of insignificance. </p>          </td>

Is this simply because our inflated egos hate to think  of life as only temporary, or is it because our being is  associated with a higher power? People argue that any thoughts of a hereafter  are wishful thinking. I used to do so myself. However, there is logic to the concept  we were not created by accident for mere survival, and that we do operate within  a universal system which directs the physical transformation of Self for a reason.  I believe it is the voice of our souls, which tell us we do have personhood  that is not intended to die. </p>          </td>

Evil is given as the primary  example. When I ask my subjects how a loving God could permit suffering,  surprisingly there are few variations in their responses. My cases report our souls are  born of a creator which places a totally peaceful state deliberately out of reach so  we will strive harder.</div></td>

That which is not good is testing us, otherwise we would  have no motivation� to�  better� the� world�  through� ourselves,� and�  no� way� to�  measure advancement. When I ask my subjects about the alternating merciful and  wrathful qualities  we perceive to be the self-expression of a teacher-oversoul, some of them say  the creator only shows certain attributes to us for specific ends. For  instance, if we  equate evil with justice and mercy with goodness and if God allowed us only to know mercy, there would be no  state of justice. </p>
          <p align="justify">This book presents a theme of order and wisdom rising from many  spiritual energy levels. In a remarkable underlying message, particularly from advanced  subjects, the possibility is held out that the God-oversoul of <em>our</em> universe is  on a less-than-perfect  level.

Earth  is one of countless worlds with intelligent beings, each with its own set of imperfections to bring into  harmony. Extending this thought further, we might exist as one single� dimensional universe out of many, each having  its own creator governing at a different level of proficiency in levels similar to the  progression of souls seen in this book. Under this pantheon, the divine being of our  particular house  would be allowed to govern in His, Her, or Its own way. </p>          </td>

            <p>If the souls who go to planets in our universe  are the offspring of a parent oversoul who is made wiser  by our struggle, then could we have a more divine grandparent who  is <em>th</em>e absolute God? The concept that our immediate God is still evolving as we  are takes nothing away from an ultimate source of perfection who spawned  our God. To my mind, a supreme, perfect God would not lose omnipotence or total  control over all creation by allowing for the maturation of  less-than-perfect superior offspring. These lesser gods could  be allowed to create their own imperfect worlds as a final means of edification  so they might join with the ultimate God. </p>

who is  physically suffering, for example, from a terminal illness. Pain in life is 
especially  insidious because it can block the healing power of our souls, especially if 
we  have not accepted what is happening to us as a�  preordained� trial.� Yet, 
throughout  life, our karma is designed so that each trial will not be too great for us

Our soul may be traveling away from a permanent home, but we are not just tourists. We  bear responsibility in the evolution of a higher  consciousness for ourselves and others in life. Thus, our journey is a collective one. <br>

              seems in the last few thousand years there has been tighter blocking, on  a conscious level, of our immortal memories. This has been a  contributing factor in the loss of faith in our capacity for  self-transcendence. Earth is filled with people who feel an

The  awareness that we do belong somewhere is reassuring and offers us peace, not merely as  a haven from conflict, but to unify ourselves with a universal mind.
