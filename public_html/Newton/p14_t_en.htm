            <p>By now I'm sure it is understood that souls  returning from the place of life selection 
              must not only sort out the best choice of who they are going to be in  their next life, 
              but coordinate this decision with other players in the coming drama.  Using the 
              analogy of life as being one big stage play, we will have the lead role  as an actor or 
              actress. Everything we do in the play affects other minor characters (minor  because 
              they are not us) in the script. Their parts can be altered by us and  ours by them 
              because script changes (the result of free will) can be made while the  play is in 
              progress. Those souls who are going to have a close association with us  on the stage 
              of life represent our supporting cast, each with prominent roles. But  how will we 
              know them? </p>

Eventually, most of my  subjects answer their own questions in superconsciousness because finding these souls  was an integral part of their preparations for leaving the spirit world. The space souls  go to for this in the spirit world is commonly called the place� of�  recognition,� or� recognition�  class.� I� am�  told� the� activity�  here� is� like cramming for a final exam.

            <p>In order to clearly understand what is behind the  spiritual activity of a recognition class, perhaps the word soulmate ought to  be defined. For many of us, our nearest and dearest  soulmate is our spouse. Yet, as we have seen in previous cases, souls of consequence  in our lives may also be other family members or a close friend.

This is a mental and physical attraction which is so strong neither partner doubts  that they were meant for each other. <br>
            <br>
            Second,  there are relationships based upon companionship, friendship, and mutual respect. Finally, we have associations based  largely upon more casual acquaintances which offer  some purposeful ingredient to our life. Thus, a soulmate can take many forms,  and meeting people who fall into one of these categories is no game of Russian  roulette. </p>          </td>

I have had clients come to me with the assumption  that they are probably not with a soulmate because of so much turmoil and  heartbreak in their marriages and relationships. They fail to realize that  karmic lessons set difficult standards for each of us and  painful experiences involving the heart are deliberate tests in  life. They are often of the hardest kind. </p>

It is also true our conscious  amnesia can make meeting significant people difficult and we  may take a wrong turn and miss the connection at some  juncture. However, there can be a prearrangement here for back-up  contingencies. </p>

            <p>Helping clients recognize people who were  destined to have an impact on their lives is a  fascinating aspect of my practice. I believe those who come to see me about relationships  are not in my office at a certain point in their lives by chance. Am I spoiling  the purpose of their spiritual recognition class by assisting these subjects in  recalling clues? I don't think so, for two basic reasons. What they are  not supposed to know yet probably won't be revealed in hypnosis,  while on the other hand, quite a few of my clients only want  confirmation of what they already suspect is true. <br>
I can speak about recognition signs from personal  experience, since I was blessed by three specific clues to help me find my  wife. Thumbing through <em>Look</em> magazine as a teenager, I  once saw a Christmas advertisement for Hamilton  watches modeled by a beautiful dark-haired woman dressed in white. The  caption in the ad said, &quot;To Peggy,&quot; because she was  holding a wristwatch as a gift from an imaginary husband. An  odd sensation came over me, and I never forgot the name or face. On my twentyfirst  birthday I received a watch of the same make from a favorite aunt. </p>

          <td width="66%"><p align="justify">One aspect of the two council meetings which I initially found rather  odd is that members  of the same soul group do not necessarily go before the same panel. For a while  I assumed there would always be a correlation here because ail members of a single soul group have the  same guide. I was wrong. In the minds of my subjects, even senior guides are thought  to be a couple of steps below the developmental level of the omnipotent beings who  make up their councils. They are similar to the Old Ones that Thece told us about  in Chapter 11, but with more specific responsibilities toward life evaluation of  souls. While a guide might, in some respects, be considered a personal confidant to a soul  this same familiarity does not extend to an Elder. In time, I came to appreciate  that an Elder's authority, unlike that of guides, involves a cross-section of souls from  many groups. </p>          </td>

            <p>Apparently,  everyone in a soul group respects the intensely private nature of these roceedings.  They all see their individual Council of Elders as godly. The Elders are 
bathed  in bright light and the whole setting has an aura of divinity. A subject put it 
this  way, &quot;when we are taken into the presence of these superior beings who  exist in 
such a high spiritual realm, it validates our feelings about the source of  creation.&quot;</p>
