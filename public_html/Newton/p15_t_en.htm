                 <p> The reader might  wonder why I would take more care with the act of birthing when I have already  brought my subjects in and out of a number of past lives during a session. There  are two reasons. First, reliving a past life does not need to involve the birthing process. I help my clients go straight from the spirit world into the next life, usually as adults. Second, if I return subjects to their current body and decide to command them to relive the birthing experience, I want to remove any minor discomforts felt by some people after they wake up.</p>

                 <p>Before continuing with this case, I should offer  a little more general information 
                   about souls and babies. All my subjects tell me the transition of their  souls from the 
                   spirit world to the mind of a baby is relatively more rapid than the  passage back. <br>
                   What is the reason for this difference? After physical death our souls  travel through 
                   the time tunnel and move past a gateway into the spirit world in a progressive  way. <br>
                   We have seen how the outward passage is intended to be more gradual than  our 
                 return to Earth in order to allow for acclimatization of a newly freed  soul. </p>

                   physical life. Then too, we are given additional time for adaptation  while in our

                 <p>At some point prior to birth, the soul will  carefully touch and join more fully with 
                   the impressionable, developing brain of a baby. When a soul decides to  enter a baby, 
                   apparently that child has no free choice in accepting or rejecting the  soul. At the 
                   moment of first entry, chronological time begins for the soul. Depending  upon the 
                   inclinations of the particular soul involved, the connection may be  early or late in 
                   the mother's pregnancy. I have had cases where souls timed their arrival  at the last 
                   minute during delivery, but this is unusual. My findings indicate even  those souls 
                   who join the baby early seem to do a lot of traveling outside the  mother's womb

                 infinite consciousness. Although I have said souls can be confined by a  human in 
                 trauma, they are never rapped. Besides leaving at the moment of death,  souls may 
                 also come and go when the body is sleeping, in deep editation, or under  an 
                 anesthetic in surgery. The soul's absences are much longer in cases of  severe brain

                   medieval theologians arbitrarily decided ensoulment took place forty  days after
