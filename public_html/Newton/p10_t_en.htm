            <p>Once our souls advance past Level II into the intermediate ranges of  development, group  cluster activity is considerably reduced. This does not mean we return to the kind of isolation we saw with  the novice soul. Souls evolving into the middle development levels have less  association with primary groups because they have acquired the maturity and  experience for operating more independently. These souls are also reducing the  number of their incarnations.</p>

            <p>Within Levels III and IV we are at last ready for  more serious responsibilities. The relationship we have with our  guides now changes from teacher-student to one of colleagues  working together.  Since   our old  guides have acquired new  student groups, it is  now our turn to develop teaching skills which will eventually qualify us for  the responsibilities of being a guide to someone else. </p>
            <p>I have said the transitional stages of Levels II  and IV are particularly difficult for 
me in pinpointing a soul's development. For instance, some Level IV souls begin 
targeting themselves toward primary cluster teacher training while still  in Level III, 
while other subjects who are clearly Level IV's find they are unsuited  to be effective <br>
guides. </p>

This client was a small, nondescript man nearly  fifty years old. His demeanor was quietly courteous towards me when we met,  and I thought him a trifle solemn. I felt his unassuming detachment was somewhat  studied, almost as a cover for stronger emotions.

As we moved forward in time, I noted a consistency of lone-wolf behavior patterns  as opposed to normal tribal integration. From about 3,000 BC to 500 BC, my  client lived a number of lives in the Middle East  during the rise of the early city states in Sumerian, Babylonian,  and Egyptian cultures.</p>

            <p>By the time we reached a life in Europe during  the Dark Ages, I was becoming accustomed to a rebellious soul  resisting tyrannical societies. During his lives, my subject worked  to uplift people from fear, while remaining non-aligned to opposing factions.  Suffering hardships and many setbacks, he continued as a wanderer with an  obsession for freedom of movement. </p>

            peasant village. In Japan, at  the beginning of the seventeenth century, he was a 
            member of the clan of the Bleeding Crane. These men were respected,  independent 
            Samurai mercenaries. At the end of this life my subject was living in  seclusion from 
            the ruling Tokugawa shoguns, because he had advised their weaker  opponents on 
          battle strategy. </p>

I was surprised when he popped up as the wife of an American farmer  on the frontier in the nineteenth century. The farmer died soon after their marriage.  I learned my subject had deliberately incarnated to be a widow with children,  tied to a piece of property, as an exercise in the loss of mobility.</p>
            <p>When this part of his session ended I knew I was  working with a more advanced, older soul, even though he had a  great many lives we did not review. Since this soul is approaching  Level IV, I would not have been surprised if his first appearance on Earth  had gone back 70,000 years rather than half that amount of time. However, as I  have mentioned, it is not an absolute prerequisite that souls have hundreds of physical  lives in order to advance. I once had a client who entered into a Level III state  of awareness after only 4,000 years - an outstanding performance.</p>

Primarily, I felt his lack of intimacy with people in  too many lives was obstructing his progress. When this session  ended, he was anxious that we explore his mind further for  perceptions about the spirit world in another session. Upon his arrival the  next day, I placed him in a superconscious state and we went back to work. </p>

I can understand why some people find  the concept of soul duality perplexing, especially when faced with the further proposition  that one soul may even be capable of living in different dimensions during  the same relative time. What we must appreciate is, if our souls are all part of  one great oversoul energy force which divides, or extends itself to create our souls,  then why shouldn't the offspring of this intelligent soul energy have the same capacity  to detach and then recombine? </p>

            <p>I have found it is not necessary for souls to go  to physical worlds when they begin

              hard to harmonize our thoughts and fine-tune our ability to all focus on  one thing 
              with the same intensity. One time we were working on a tree leaf after  Senwa 
              demonstrated how it should appear in front of us. As we directed our  beams of 
              energy for texture, color, and shape we kept messing up. We weren't  unified, so a 
              small part of the leaf did not have the proper veining and pigmentation.  I am very 
              serious and kind of a perfectionist in my studies, but Nemi (the group  jokester) was 
              deliberately alternating his energy the wrong way to screw up the  experiment for 
              laughs and because he was tired of the lesson. We finally got him to  behave and

            <p>  I am told that early creation training  consists of souls learning relationships between substances to develop the  ability of unifying their energy with different values in the  elements. The formation of inanimate to animate objects from the simple  to the complex is a long, slow process. Students are encouraged to create miniature  planetary microhabitats for a given set of organisms which can adapt to certain  environmental conditions. With practice comes improvement, but not until they  approach Level V do my clients begin to feel they might actually contribute to 
the  development of living things. We will hear more about this with Case 23. </p>
