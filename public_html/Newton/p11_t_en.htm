The  fact is, a person whose maturity is this high doesn't seek out a regression therapist to  resolve life-plan conflicts. In most cases, Level V's are here as incarnated guides. Having  mastered the fundamental issues most of us wrestle with daily, the  advanced soul is more interested in making small refinements toward specific tasks.</div></td>

appear  to be at odds with the wrongs of an imperfect world. I see no correlation 
here.  Being emotional, appreciating beauty, or having extrasensory impressions - including  psychic talent - does not necessarily denote an advanced soul. </p>

During the warmer climate of the middle Paleolithic period of  Earth's history, my subject described living in moist, sub-tropical savannas near  hunting, fishing, and plant-gathering areas.

Within the last 100,000 years, we find two clear signs of spiritual  consciousness  and communication. These are burial practices and ritualistic art, as found in carved totems and  rock drawings.

            <p>One of my advanced subjects remarked, &quot;Souls  have seeded the Earth in different cycles.&quot; A composite of  information collected from a wide range of clients suggests to me that the land  masses we know today deviate from earlier continents, drowned, perhaps, by  cataclysmic volcanic or magnetic upheavals. For instance, the Azores in the Atlantic   Ocean have been said to represent the tops of  mountains of the submerged continent of Atlantis. Indeed, I have  had subjects discuss being in ancient lands on Earth that I  cannot identify with modern geography. </p>
            Thus,  it is possible souls existed in bodies more advanced than <em>Homo erectus,</em> who 
died out about a quarter of a million years ago, with the fossilized evidence  hidden 
from  us today by geological change. However, this hypothesis means the physical 
evolution  of humans was an up, down, up affair, which I think is unlikely.</div></td>

this life, counseling a benevolent tribal chief as his influential wife.  I tentatively 
located their land as the highlands of Ethiopia. Apparently, my subject  had known 
Kumara in a number of earlier lives covering thousands of years during  Kumara's

One advanced subject told me he had  lived on a number of worlds in his long existence, never dividing his soul more than  twice at one time. Some adult lives lasted only months in Earth time for him, due to  local planetary conditions and short life spans of the dominant life form. </div></td>

When souls travel to  planets intergalactically or interdimensionally, they measure the trip by the time  it takes them to reach their destinations through the tunnel effect from the spirit  world. The size of the spatial region involved and the relative position of worlds to  each other are also considerations. After listening to references about multiple  dimensional realities from some of my subjects, I am left with the impression they  believe there is a confluence of all these dimensional streams into one great river  of the spirit world. </p>          </td>

              itself? </p>

            <p>With this last prophetic statement by Thece, I  ended the session. As I brought this subject out of her deep trance, it  was as though she were returning to me from across time and  space. As she sat quietly focusing her eyes around my office, I expressed  my appreciation for the opportunity of working with her on such an advanced  level. Smiling, the lady said if she had any idea of the grilling in store for her,  she might well have refused to work with me. <br>
              <br>
              As we said goodbye, I thought about her last  statements concerning the source of life. In ancient Persia the Sufis had a  saying that if the creator represents absolute good,  and   therefore  absolute  beauty,   it  is  the   nature  of  beauty   to  desire manifestation. </p>
