I try to take a common sense approach in bringing  past and present experiences into alignment. </p>
            Our  eternal identity never leaves us alone in the bodies we choose, despite our 
current  status. In reflection, meditation, or prayer, the memories of who we really 
are do  filter down to us in selective thought each day. In small, intuitive ways -
through  the cloud of amnesia - we are given clues the justification of our being. </div></td>

            <p>After a case is completed, I never cease to  admire the brutal honesty of souls. When a soul has lead  a productive life beneficial to themselves and those around them, I notice  they return to the spirit world with enthusiasm. However, when subjects like Case  13 report they wasted a past life, especially from early suicide, then they describe  going back rather dejected.</p>
            <p>When orientation is upsetting to a subject, I  find an underlying reason is the 
abruptness with which a soul is once again in full possession of all  knowledge. After 
physical death, unencumbered by a human body, the soul has a sudden  influx of 
perception. The stupid things we did in life hit us hard in orientation.  I see more 
relaxation and greater clarity of thought move my subjects further into the  spirit 
world. </p>

Humans have the raw, negative emotions  of anger and hate as an outgrowth of their fear and pain connected with survival  going back to the Stone Age. </p>

            <p>If a soul only  knew love and peace, it would gain no insight and never truly  appreciate the value of these positive feelings. The test of reincarnation for  a soul coming to Earth is the conquering of fear in a human body. A soul grows by  trying to overcome all negative emotions connected to fear through perseverance in many lifetimes, often returning to the spirit  world bruised or hurt, as Case 13 indicated. Some of this negativity  can be retained, even in the spirit world, and may reappear in  another life with a new body. On the other hand, there is a trade-off. It's� in joy and unabashed pleasure that the true  nature of an individual soul is revealed on earth in the face of a  happy human being. </p>

            <p>Orientation conferences with our guides allow us  to begin the long process of self-evaluation between lives. Soon we will have another conference, this  time with more 
              master beings in attendance. In the last chapter, I referred to the  ancient Egyptian 
              tradition of newly deceased souls being taken into a Hall of Judgement  to account 
              for their past life. In one form or another, the concept of a torturous  courtroom trial 
              awaiting us right after death has been part of the religious belief  system of many 
              cultures. Occasionally, a susceptible individual in a traumatic  situation will say they 
              had� an� out-of-body�  experience� with� nightmarish�  visions� of� being�  taken� by 
              frightening specters into an afterlife of darkness where they were  sentenced in front 
              of demonic judges. In these cases, I suspect a strong preconditioned  belief system of 
              hell. </p>
