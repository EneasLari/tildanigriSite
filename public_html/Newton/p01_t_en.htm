            <p>THESE are the  words spoken by a man in deep hypnosis, reliving a death experience.  His words come in short, excited bursts and are full of awe, as he sees and  feels what it is like to be a spirit newly separated from a physical body. This  man is my client and I have just assisted him in recreating a past life death  scene while he lies back in a comfortable recliner chair. A  little earlier, following my instructions during his trance  induction, this subject was age-regressed in a return to childhood  memories. His subconscious perceptions gradually coalesced as we worked  together to reach his mother's womb. </p>

It was  a short life because he had died suddenly from the influenza epidemic of 1918.<br>
              As  the initial shock of seeing himself die and feeling his soul floating out of  his body begins to wear off a little, my client adjusts more  readily to the visual images in his mind. </p>

            Yet,   within  a  few moments he settles in and begins to  respond with greater confidence to my questions. I quickly raise this  subject's subconscious hypnotic level into the uperconscious  state. Now he is ready to talk to me about the spirit world, and  I ask what is happening to him.</p>

              hypnosis become more connected to the spiritual passageway. As the  session moves 
              forward, the subject's mental pictures are more easily translated into  words. Short

Souls are quite capable of leaving and  returning to their host bodies, particularly in life-threatening situations when  the body is dying.

              wagon train in 1866. Although this case and the last one relate death  experiences 
              after their most immediate past lives, a particular death date in  history has no

            <p>The scene in Case 2 opens on the American southern plains right after an arrow has struck Sally in the neck at close range. I am always careful with death scenes involving violent trauma in past lives because the subconscious mind often still retains these experiences. The subject in this case came to me because of a lifetime  of  throat  discomfort.  Release  therapy  and  deprogramming  is  usually required in these cases. In all past life recall, I use the time around death for quiet review and place the subject in observer status to soften pain and emotion.</p>

   <p><b>S:</b> Oh, good ... he isn't hurt ... but ... (with  sadness) he is holding my body ... crying over me ... there is nothing he can  do for me, but he doesn't seem to realize that yet. I'm cold, but  his hands are around my face ... kissing me. <br>

arrangement  periods  for  souls.   Souls  really  have   no  morbid  curiosity   to  see 
themselves  buried because emotions in the spirit world are not the same as we 
experience  here on Earth. Yet, I find soul entities appreciate the respect given to the 
memory  of their physical life by surviving relatives and friends.</p>

A few hours later we returned  to my mother's empty house with our spouses and decided to take a needed rest.  My sister and I must have reached the receptive Alpha state at about the same time.  Appearing in two separate rooms, my mother came through our subconscious minds  as a dream-like brush of whiteness above our heads. Reaching out, she smiled,  indicating her acceptance of death and current well-being. Then she floated away.  Lasting only seconds, this act was a meaningful form of closure, causing both of  us to release into a sound sleep of the Delta state.</p>

            <p>My clients tell me as souls they are able  to help those on Earth connect their inner minds to the spirit world itself  As it has been wisely said, people are not really gone as long as  they are remembered by those left on Earth. In the chapters ahead,  we will see how specific memory is a reflection of our own soul,  while collective memories are the atoms of pure energy for all souls. Death  does not break our continuity with the immortal soul of those we love simply because  they have lost the physical personhood of a mortal body. Despite their many  activities, these departed souls are still able to reach us if called upon. </p>

The mind takes a short cut  through this sort of progression when we face death suddenly. As the end of our physical  life draws near, each of us has the capacity to fuse with our higher  consciousness.
