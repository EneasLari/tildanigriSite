            <p>I have never worked with a subject in trance who  did not have a personal guide. Some guides are more in evidence  than others during hypnosis sessions. It is my custom to ask  subjects if they see feel a discarnate presence in the room. If they do, this  third party is usually a protective guide. Often, a client will sense the  presence of a discarnate figure before visualizing a face or  hearing a voice. People who meditate a great deal are  naturally more familiar with these visions than someone who  never called upon his or her guide. </p>

level  of the soul determines to some extent the degree of advancement of the guide 
assigned  to them. In fact, the maturity of a particular guide also has a bearing on 
whether  these teachers have only one student or many under their direction. Guides 
at the  senior level of ability and above usually work with an entire group of souls in 
the  spirit world and on earth. These guides have other entities who assist them. 
From  what I can see, every soul group usually has one or more rather new teachers 
in  training. As a result, some people may have more than one guide helping them. </div></td>

traced  back to a specific past life a teacher spent with a student. Some clients are 
unable  to verbalize their guide's name because the sound cannot be duplicated, even 
when they see them clearly while under hypnosis. I tell these people it is much  more 
important  that they under stand the purpose of why certain guides are assigned to 
them,  rather than possessing their names. A subject may simply use a general 
designation  for their� guide such as:� director,�  advisor,� instructor,� or�  just� &quot;my

            <p>One has to be careful how the word <em>friend</em> is  interpreted. Usually, when a person in trance talks  about a spiritual friend, they are referring to a soul-mate or peer group  associate rather than a guide.

            <p>One of the most important aspects of my  therapeutic work with clients is assisting them, on a  conscious level, with appreciating the role their guides play in life. These teacher  entities edify all of us with their skillful instruction techniques. Ideas we claim  as our own may be generated by a concerned guide. Guides also comfort us during the trying periods in our lives,  especially when we are children in need of solace. I remember a charming remark  made by a subject after I asked when she began seeing  her guide in this life. &quot;Oh, when I was daydreaming,&quot; she said.  &quot;I remember my guide was with me on my first day of  school when I was really scared. She sat on top of my desk to keep  me company and then showed me the way to the bathroom when I  was too afraid to ask the teacher.&quot; </p>

            <p>The concept of personalized spiritual beings goes  far back in antiquity to our earliest origins as thinking human  beings. Anthropological studies at the sites of prehistoric� people�  suggest� their� totemic�  symbols� evoked� individual�  protection. Later, some 5,000 years ago as city-states arose,  official deities became identified with state religions. These gods were more  remote and even generated fear. Thus, personal and family deities  assumed great importance in the day-to-day life of people for protection. A  personal soul deity served as a guardian angel to each person or  family, and could be called upon for divine help during a crisis. This tradition  has been carried down into our cultures of today. </p>

and dreams, Aumakua can either assist or reprimand an individual. In  northeastern 
America, the Iroquois believe a  human's own inner spiritual power is called Orenda, 
which is connected to a higher personal Orenda spirit. This guardian is able to  resist 
the  powers of harm and evil directed at an individual. The concept of soul watchers

              life� paths&quot; and are  considered the caretakers of souls. There are other cultures

              anthropomorphic figures below a supreme God to portray the spiritual  forces 
              around them. When people pray or meditate, they want to reach out to an  entity 
              with whom they are acquainted for inspiration. It is easier to ask for  aid from a 
              figure which can be clearly identified in the human mind. There is a  lack of imagery <br>
with a supreme God which hinders a direct connection for many people. Regardless 
              of our diverse religious preferences and degrees of faith, people also  feel if there is a 
              supreme God, this divinity is too busy to bother about their individual  problems. 
              People often express an unworthiness for a direct association with God. As  a result, 
              the world's major religions have used prophets who once lived on Earth  to serve as 
              our intermediaries with God. </p>

Millions  of people derive benefit from the teachings of these powerful souls who incarnated  on Earth as prophets in our historical past.

             <p>All guides have compassion for their students,  but teaching approaches vary. I find some guides constantly helping  their students on Earth, while others demand their charges work  out lessons with little overt encouragement. The maturity of the soul is,  of course, a factor. Certainly graduate students get less help than freshmen.  Aside from the developmental level, I look at the intensity  of individual desire as another consideration in the frequency of  appearance and form of assistance one receives from his or her  guide during a life. </p>

             <p>As to gender assignments, I find no consistent  correlation of male and female subjects to masculine or feminine  appearing guides. On the whole, people accept the gender  portrayed by their guide as quite natural. It could be argued that this is because  they have become used to them over eons of relative time as males or females  rather than the assumption that one sex IS more effective than another between  specific students and teachers. Some guides appear as mixed genders, which  lends support to souls being truly androgynous. One client told me, &quot;My guide  is sometimes Alexis or Alex, dropping in and out of both sexes, depending on my  need for male or female advice.&quot; </p>
             <p>From what I can determine, the procedure for  teacher selection� is� carefully 
managed in the spirit world. Every human being has at least one senior,  or a higher 
master guide, assigned to their soul since the soul was first created. Many  of us 
inherit� a� newer, secondary guide later in our  existence, such as Karla, in the 
previous chapter. For want of a better term, I have called these student  teachers 
junior guides. </p>

             <p>Aspiring junior guides can anticipate the  beginning of their training near the end of Level III, as  they progress into the upper intermediate stages of development. Actually,  we begin our training as subordinate guides long before attaining Level IV. In  the lower stages of development we help others in life as friends and between lives assist our peer group associates with  counseling. Junior and senior teaching assignments  appear to reflect� the� will of�  master guides,� who form a kind of  governing body, similar to a trusteeship, over the younger guides of the  spirit world. We will see examples of how the process of guide  development works in Chapters Ten and Eleven, which cover cases  of more advanced souls. Do all guides have the same teaching abilities,  and does this affect the size of the group to which we are assigned in  the spirit world? The following passage is from the case file  of an experienced soul who discussed this question with me.<br>

               contact was only fleeting when he came to help her. Abruptly, I asked if  Owa might 
               possibly be in her life now? After a moment of hesitation, my subject  began to shake 
               uncontrollably. Tears came to her eyes and she cried out from the vision  in her 
              mind. </p>

             <p>Do we ever catch up to our guides in development?  Eventually, perhaps, but I can say I have not seen any evidence  of this in my cases. Souls who develop relatively fast are  gifted, but so are the guides who assist them. <br>
               It is not uncommon to find guides working in  pairs with people on Earth, each with their own approaches to  teaching. In these cases one is dominant, although the more experienced  senior guide may actually be less evident in day-to-day activities of their charges.  The reason for this spiritual arrangement in tandem is because one of the pair  is either in training (such as a junior guide under a senior), or the  association is so long-standing between the two guides (as with a  senior to a master) that a permanent  relationship has evolved. The senior guide may have acquired his or her own cluster of souls, which is  still monitored by a master overseeing a number of soul groups. </p>

absolute limits of my friend's ability to cope before solutions suddenly  begin to

             <p>What is the average spiritual guide like? In my  experience, no two guides are the same.

They can be cooperative or obstructive, tolerant or disobliging,  evasive or revealing, or just flat out unconcerned with  anything I do with a subject. I have great respect for guides because  these powerful figures play such an important part in our destiny,  but I must admit they can frustrate my inquiries. I find them enigmatic  because they are unpredictable in their relations with me as a facilitator. </p>
             <p>Early in this century, it was common for mediums  working with people in hypnosis to call any discarnate entity in  the room a &quot;control,&quot; because they acted as the director of  communications on the spiritual side for the subject. It was recognized that a  spiritual control (whether a guide or not) had energy patterns which were in emotional,  intellectual, and spiritual attunement with the subject. The importance of a  harmonious energy pattern between facilitator and these entities was also  known.</p>

Our relationship with guides is one of students  and teachers rather than defendants and judges. Our personal guides help us  cope with the separateness and isolation which every soul inherits at physical  birth, regardless of the degree of love extended by our family. Guides give us  an affirmation of Self in a crowded world. <br>
               <br>
             People want to know if their guides always come  whenever they call for help.</p>

             <p> Guides are not consistent in the manner  in which they choose to assist us, because they carefully  evaluate how badly they are needed. I am also asked if hypnosis is the best way  to get in contact with one's guide. Naturally, I lean toward hypnosis, because  I know how potent and effective this medium can be to obtain detailed  spiritual information. However, hypnosis by a trained  facilitator is not convenient on a daily basis, where meditation, prayer, and  perhaps channeling with another person would be. Self-hypnosis, as a form of  deep meditation, is an excellent alternative and may be preferred by  those who have a fear of being hypnotized by others, or don't want the  interference of a second party in their spiritual life. </p>
             <p>Regardless of the method used, we all have the  capacity to send out far-reaching 
thought waves from our higher consciousness. Every person's thoughts  represent a 
mental fingerprint to guides marking who and where we are. During our lives, 
especially� in periods of great  stress, most people feel the presence of someone 
watching out for them. We may not be able to describe this power, but it  is there 
nonetheless. </p>

             <p>Reaching our soul is the first step on the ladder  of finding our higher power. All lines of mental communication we  use to reach a God-head are monitored by our guides on this  step. They, too, have their guides further up the ladder. The entire ladder  serves as one unbroken conduit to the source of all intelligent energy, with each  rung being part of the whole. It is essential for people to have faith that a prayer  for help will be answered by 
               their <em>own</em> higher power. This is why guides are  vitally important to our spiritual 
               and temporal lives. If we are relaxed and in a state of concentrated  focus, an inner 
               voice speaks to us. And, even if we didn't initiate the message, we  should trust what 
              we hear. </p>

When  they are in trance, my clients see that their guides don't  help them solve all their problems at once, rather they illuminate pathways  by the use of clues. This is one reason why I am cautious about client-blocking  during hypnosis. Insight is best revealed with a controlled pace relative to 
each person. A concerned teacher may not want all aspects of a problem  uncovered 
at a  given point in time for his or her student. We vary in our ability to handle

I suspect we don't have a  whole lot of these advanced souls on Earth at any one time. Most Level VI's  are much too involved with planning and directing from the spirit world to incarnate  any longer. From the reports of the Level V's I have had, it would seem the  Level VI has no new lessons to learn, but I have a hunch a still-incarnating  soul at Level V may not know all the esoteric tasks involved with master  level entities. </p>

People in hypnosis say they feel  the presence of a supreme power directing the spirit world,  but they are uncomfortable using the word &quot;God&quot; to  describe a creator.
