            <p>MY impression of the people who believe we do  have a soul is that they imagine all souls are probably mixed into one great  congregation of space. Many of my subjects believe this  too, before their sessions begin. After awakening, it is no wonder they express surprise with the knowledge that everyone  has a designated place in the spirit world. When I began to  study life in the spirit world with people under hypnosis, I was  unprepared to hear about the existence of organized soul support groups.  I had pictured spirits just floating around aimlessly by themselves after leaving  Earth. </p>

After physical death, a  soul's journey back home ends with debarkation into the space reserved for their own  colony, as long  as they are not a very young soul or isolated for other reasons as mentioned in  Chapter Four. The souls represented in these cluster groups are intimate old  friends who  have about the same awareness level.</p>
            <p>When people in trance speak of being part of a  soul cluster group, they are talking about a small primary unit of  entities who have direct and frequent contact, such as we would see in  a human family. Peer members have a sensitivity to each other which  is far beyond our conception on Earth.</p>

            <p>Secondary groups of souls are arranged in the  form of a community Support group which is much less intimate with  one another. Larger secondary groups of entities are made up of  giant sets of primary clusters as lily pads in one pond. Spiritual ponds  appear to be endless. Within these ponds, I have never heard of a secondary group  estimated at less than a thousand souls. The many primary group clusters which  make up one secondary group seem to have sporadic relationships, or no contact  at all between clusters. It is rare for me to find souls involved with each other  in any meaningful way who are members of two different secondary groups, because  the number of souls is so great it is not necessary. </p>

This may be due to a past life  connection, or the particular identity trait of the souls involved.  Soul acquaintanceships between members of  different cluster groups usually involve peripheral roles in life on Earth. </p>          </td>

This circumstance exists not  for reasons of maturity, since a parent soul could be less developed than  their human offspring.

            <p>Figures  1 and 2  represent a random spiritual setting of souls. In Figure  1, a soul in primary Group 1, located within the larger secondary Group A, would  work closely with all other souls in Group 1. However, some souls in primary Groups  9 and 10 (detailed in Figure 2) could also work together. The younger souls  within secondary Groups A, B, and C would probably have little or no contact  with each other in the spirit world or on Earth. Close association between  souls depends on their assigned proximity to one another in cluster  groups, where there is a similarity 0f knowledge and affinity brought  about by shared earthly experiences. <br>

            <p>For instance, many subjects mentally traveling  from one location to another in the spirit world will tell me the  space around them is like a sphere, as we saw in the last  chapter, but then they will add that the spirit world is not enclosed because  it is &quot;limitless.&quot; I think what we have to keep in mind is that  people tend to structure their frame of reference during a trance  state with what their conscious mind sees and has experienced on Earth. Quite a  few people who come out of trance tell me there is so much about the  spirit world they were unable to describe in earthly  terms.   Each  person  translates   abstract  spiritual  conditions   of  their experience into  symbols of interpretation which make sense to them. Sometimes a subject  will even express disbelief at their own visions when I first take them into a spiritual  place.

Using only this criterion of identification,  it was difficult for me to swiftly place a client. Case 16 came to me early in  my studies of life in the spirit world. It was a significant one, because during the session I  was to learn about the recognition of souls by color. Before this case, I listened  to my subjects describing the colors they were seeing in the spirit world without  appreciating the importance of this information in relation to souls themselves. My  clients reported about shades of soul energy mass, but I didn't piece these  observations together. I was not asking the right questions. </p>

The energy of radiated light from cooler stars in the sky is a  redorange,  while the hotter stars increase from yellow to blue-white. Temperature acts on light  waves that are also visible vibrations  of  the spectrum with different frequencies. The human eye  registers these waves as a band of light to dark colors. </p>
            <p align="justify">The energy colors of souls probably have little to do with such elements  as hydrogen and  helium, but perhaps there is an association   with  a  high   energy  field  of electromagnetism. I suspect all soul light is  influenced by vibrational motion in tune with a harmonious spiritual  oneness of wisdom. Some aspects of quantum physics suggest the universe is made  up of vibrational waves which influence masses of physical objects by an  interaction of different frequencies. Light, motion, sound, and time are all interrelated in  physical space. I was hearing these same relationships applied to spiritual matter  from my cases. </p>

              soul's aura. As souls, the density, color, and form of light we radiate  is proportional 
              to  the  power of   our  knowledge  and   perception  as  represented   by  increasing 
              concentrations of light matter as we develop. Individual patterns of  energy not only 
              display who we are, but indicate the degree of ability to heal others  and regenerate 
              ourselves. </p>

In the visible spectrum on Earth, blue-violet  has the shortest wavelength, with energy peaking in the invisible ultraviolet. If  color density is a reflection of wisdom, then the lower wavelengths of white  through yellow emanating from souls must represent lower concentrations of vibrational  energy. </div></td>

            <p>Figure 3  is a chart I have designed  for the classification of souls by color coding, as  reported by my subjects. The first column lists the soul's spiritual state, or  grade-level of learning. The last column shows our guide status and denotes our  ability and readiness to serve in that capacity for others, which will  be explained further in the next chapter. Learning begins with our  creation as a soul and then accelerates with the first physical life  assignment. With each incarnation, we grow in understanding,  although we may slip back in certain lives before regaining our footing and  advancing again. Nevertheless, from what I can determine, once a spiritual  level is attained by the soul, it stays there. </p>

            <p>In Figure 3, I show six levels of incarnating  souls. Although I generally place my subjects into the broad categories  of beginner, intermediate, and advanced souls, there are  subtle differences in between, at  Levels  II and IV. For example, to determine whether a soul is  starting to move out of the beginner stage at Level I into Level  II, I must not only know how much white energy remains, but analyze the subject's  responses to questions which demonstrate learning. A genealogy of past life successes,  future expectations, group associations, and conversations between my subjects  and their guides, all form a profile of growth. </p>

            <p>This chapter may give the reader the impression  that souls are as segregated by 
              light  level in the spirit  world as people are by class in communities  on Earth. 
              Societal  conditions  on   Earth  cannot  be   compared  with  the   spirit  world.  The 
              differences in light frequency measuring knowledge in souls all comes  from the same 
              energy source. Souls are fully integrated by thought. If all levels of  performance in 
              the spirit world were on one grade level, souls would have a poor system  of training. 
              The old one-room schoolhouse concept of education on Earth limited  students of 
              different ages. In spiritual peer groups, souls work at their own  developmental level 
              with others like them. Mature teacher-guides prepare succeeding  generations of 
              souls to take their places. </p>

It is important to understand that  while we may suffer the consequences of bad choices in our educational tasks, we  are always protected, supported, and directed within the system by master  souls. I see this as the spiritual management of souls. </p>

            <p>The whole idea of a hierarchy of souls has been  part of both Eastern and Western cultures   for  many centuries.  Plato   spoke of  the  transformation  of souls   from childhood to adulthood passing through many stages of  moral reason. The Greeks felt humankind moves from amoral, immature, and  violent beings over many lives to people who are finally  socialized with pity, patience, forgiveness, honesty, and love.  In the second century AD, the new Christian theology was greatly influence by Polotinus,  whose Neoplatonist  cosmology involved souls having a hierarchy  of degrees of being. The highest being was a transcendent One, or God-creator,  out of which  the soul-self was born which would occupy humans. Eventually, these lowersouls would return to complete  reunion with the universal over-soul. </p>

            <p>* Regardless of the relative time of creation  after their novice status is completed, all beginner souls are assigned to a  new group of souls at their level of understanding. </p>
            <p>* Once a new soul support group is formed, no new  members are added in the future. </p>
            <p>* There appears to be a systematic selection  procedure for homogeneous groupings of souls. Similarities of ego,  cognitive awareness, expression, and desire are all considerations. <br>
              <br>
              * Irrespective of size, cluster groups do not  directly intermix with each other's energy, but souls can communicate  with one another across primary and secondary group  boundaries. <br>
              <br>
              * Primary clusters in Levels I and II may split  into smaller subgroups for study, but are not separated from the  integrated whole
              within  a single cluster of souls. </p>
            <p>* Rates of learning vary among peer group  members. Certain souls will advance faster than others in a cluster  group, although these students may not be equally competent and  effective in all areas of their curricula. Around the intermediate level of  learning, souls demonstrating special talents (healing, teaching, creating,  etc.) are permitted to participate in specialty groups for more  advanced work while still remaining with their cluster  group. </p>
            <p>* At the point where a soul's needs, motives and  performance abilities are judged to be fully at Level III in all areas  of self-development, they are then loosely formed into an  &quot;independent studies&quot; work group. Usually, their old guides continue  to monitor them through one master teacher. Thus, a new pod of entities  graduating into full Level III could be brought together from  many clusters within one or more secondary groups. </p>
            <p>*  When they approach Level IV, souls are given more independence outside group activities.   Although group size diminishes as souls advance, the intimate contact between  original peer group members is never lost. </p>
