            <p>There are two types of beginner souls: souls who  are truly young in terms of exposure� to�  an� existence� out�  of� the� spirit�  world,� and� souls�  who� have� been reincarnating  on Earth for a long period of relative time, but still remain immature. I  find beginner souls of both types in Levels I and II. <br>
I believe almost three-quarters of all souls who  inhabit human bodies on Earth 
today� are� still�  in� the� early�  stages� of� development.�  I� know� this�  is� a� grossly 
discouraging statement because it means most of our human population is  operating 
at the lower end of their training. On the other hand, when I consider a  world 
population beset by so much negative cross-cultural misunderstanding and  violence, 
I am not inclined to change my opinion about the high percentage of  lower level 
souls on Earth. However, I do think each century brings improvement of  awareness 
in all humans. </p>

          <td><div align="justify">Over a number of years, I have maintained a statistical count of client  soul levels in my case files. Undoubtedly, the figures are weighted to some extent at  the lower levels  because these subjects were not selected at random. My cases could be overrepresented by souls at the  lower levels of development because they are the very people who require assistance  in life and might come to me seeking information. <br>

            <p>For  those who are curious, the percentages by soul level of all my cases are as follows: Level I, 42%; Level  II, 31%; Level III, 17%; Level IV, 9%; and Level V, 1%. Projecting these figures  into a world population of five billion souls would be unreliable, using my small  sample. Nevertheless, I see the Possibility we may have only a few hundred thousand  people on Earth at Level V. </p>
            <p>My subjects state that souls end their  incarnations on Earth when they reach full maturity. What  is significant about the high percentage of souls in the early stages of  development is our rapidly multiplying population and the urgency babies have for  available souls. We are increasing by 260,000 children per day. This human necessity  for souls means they must normally be drawn from a spiritual pool of less advanced  entities who require more incarnations to progress and are, therefore, more  available to return to another life. <br>
              <br>
I am sensitive to the feelings of clients whom I  know to be in the early stages of development. I cannot count the  number of times a new client has come into my office and said,  &quot;I know I am an old soul, but I seem to have problems coping with life.&quot;  We all want to be advanced souls because most people hate to be considered a beginner  in anything. Every case is unique. There are many variables within each soul's� character, �individual�  development� rate,� and�  the� qualities� of�  the� guides assigned  to them. I see my task as offering interpretations of what subjects report to me  about the progression of their souls. </p>

However, he has gained compassion. <br>
The  next case represents an absolute beginner soul. This novice shows no evidence of having a spiritual group  assignment as yet, because she has lived too few past lives. In her first life she  was killed in 1260 AD in Northern Syria by a Mongol invasion. Her name was Shabez,  and her settlement was sacked, resulting in a terrible massacre of the  inhabitants when she was five years old.</p>

            <p>Case 20 has some obvious traits of the immature  soul. The subject is a sixty-seven-year-old woman who has had a lifetime of getting into disastrous ruts. She does  not 
              demonstrate a generosity of spirit toward others, nor does she take much  personal 
              responsibility for her actions. This client came to me searching for  answers as to 
              why life had &quot;cheated me out of happiness.&quot; In our session we  learned Ahmed was 
              her first husband, Bill. She left him long ago for another man, whom she  also

At this stage they are less dependent  upon close supervision and special nurturing from their guides. </p>

            <p>For the younger souls, the first realization that  they are part of a substantial group of spirits like themselves is a  source of delight. Generally, I find this important spiritual event has  occurred by the end of a fifth life on Earth, regardless of the relative  length of time the novice soul was in semi-isolation. Some of the entities of these  new spiritual groups are the souls of relatives and friends with whom the young  soul was associated in their few past lives on Earth. What is especially  significant about the formation of a new cluster group is that other peer group  members are also newer souls who find themselves together for the first  time. </p>

              pictorial scenes, as reported by this subject. Case� 21 will offer a more detailed 
              account of spiritual group dynamics and how members impact on each  other. The 
              capacity of souls to learn certain lessons may be stronger or weaker  between one 
              another depending upon inclination, motivation, and prior incarnation  experience. 
              Cluster groups are carefully designed to give peer support through a  sensitivity of 
              identity traits between all members. This cohesiveness is far beyond  what we know

The common approaches these souls use in finding personal value is one  indication why they are working together. <br>
              <br>
The extravagant behavior modes of these souls is  offset, to some extent, by their spiritual prescience. Since the  complete truth is known by all group members about each other in a  telepathic world, humor is indispensible. Some readers may find it hard to  accept that souls do joke with each other about their failings, but humor is the  basis upon which self-deception and hypocrisy are exposed. </p>

But a support group is also designed  to have differences in disposition, feelings, and reactions.

            <p>The desire for expression of self-identity is an  important motivating factor for souls choosing to come to Earth to  learn practical lessons. Sometimes a reason for discomfort with  the lower level soul is the discrepancy in perception of Self in their free  soul state, compared to how they act in human bodies. Souls can get confused with  who they are in life. Case 21 did not seem to exhibit any conflict in this  area, but I question the rate of growth achieved by Allum in  recent past lives.
