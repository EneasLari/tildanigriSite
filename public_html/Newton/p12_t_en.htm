              <p>There comes that time when the soul must once again leave the sanctuary  of the spirit  world for another trip to Earth. This decision is not an easy one. Souls must prepare to leave a world of  total wisdom, where they exist in a blissful state of freedom, for the physical and  mental demands of a human body. <br>
We  have seen how tired souls can be when reentering the spirit world. Many don't  want to think about returning to Earth again. This is especially true when we  have not  come close to our goals at the end of a physical life. </p>

I hope my cases show the opposite is true in the spirit world,  where our souls are involved in the most intimate sharing on an everlasting basis.

When the wounds of a past life  are healed and we are again totally at one with ourselves, we feel the pull of  having a physical expression for our identity. Training sessions with our  counselors and peer groups have provided a collaborative spiritual effort to prepare us for the  next life. </p>            </td>

              <p align="justify">Our karma of past deeds towards humanity and our mistakes and  achievements have all been evaluated with an eye toward the best course of future  endeavors. The soul must now assimilate all this information and take purposeful action  based upon three primary decisions: </p>
              <p>* Am  I ready for a new physical life? </p>
              <p>* What specific lessons do I want to undertake to  advance my learning and development? <br>
                <br>
                * Where should I go, and who shall I be in my  next life for the best opportunity to work on my goals? </p>
              Older  souls incarnate less, regardless of the population demands of their assigned planets. When a world dies,  those entities with unfinished business move on to another world which has a  suitable life form for the kind of work they have been doing. Cycles of incarnation  for the eternal soul seem to be regulated more by the internal desires of a  particular soul, than by the urgency of host bodies evolving in a universe of planets.
              <p align="justify">Nevertheless, Earth certainly has an increasing need for souls. Today, we  have over five  billion   people.  Demographers  vary   in  their  calculations   on  how  many individuals have lived on  Earth in the last 200,000 years. The average estimate is some 50 billion people. This  figure, which I think is low, does not signify the number of visitations by different  souls. Bear in mind the same souls continue to reincarnate, and there are  those   who occupy more than one body at a time.   There are reincarnationists who believe the number of people living on Earth today  is close to the  total number of souls who ever lived here. The frequency of incarnation on Earth by souls is uneven. Earth  clearly has more need for souls today than in the past. Population estimates in  1 AD are around 200 million. By 1800, humans had quadrupled, and after only 170  more years, quadrupled again. Between 1970 and 2010, the world's population  is expected to double once more.</p>

With the  introduction of agriculture and domesticated animals in the Neolithic Age, from 7,000  to 5,000 years ago, my subjects report living more frequent lives. Still, their  lives are often spaced as much as 500 years apart. With the rise of cities,  trade, and more available food, I see the incarnation schedules of souls increasing with a growing  population. Between 1000 and 1500 AD, my clients live an average of once in two  centuries. After 1700, this changes to once in a century. By the 1900s, living more than  one life in a century is common among my cases. </p>            </td>

              <p>It has been argued these increases in soul  incarnations only appear to be so because 
                past life recall improves as people in hypnosis get closer to their current  lives. This 
                may be true to some extent, but if a life is important it will be  vividly remembered at 
                any age in time. Without doubt, the enormous population increase on  Earth is the 
                basic  cause  for   souls  coming  here   more  often.  Is there a   possibility  that  the 
                inventory of souls slated  for  Earth could be strained by this surge in human 
                reproduction? </p>
              <p>When I ask clients about the inventory of  available souls, they tell me I should worry more  about our planet dying from over-population than exhausting the reserve  of souls. There is the conviction that new souls are always available to fill any  expanding population requirements. If our planet is just one example among all other  intelligent populations which exist in this universe, the inventory of souls  must truly be astronomical.</p>

                accelerate  development,  while others are very  reluctant   to  leave.  There   is no 
                question but what our guides exert great influence in this matter. Just  as we were 
                given an intake interview in the orientation phase right after death,  there are 
                preparatory exit interviews by spiritual advisors to determine our  readiness for

They  also see people living in odd-looking domed buildings. Details  about the future are always rather limited, due, I suspect, to  built-in amnesia from karmic constraints.

              <p>The selection of a time and place for incarnation  and who we want to be are not 
                completely separate decisions. However, we start by having the  opportunity of 
                viewing how we might fit into certain environments in future time  segments. Then 
                our attention is directed to people living in these places. I was a little  distracted by 
                this procedure until I realized a soul is largely influenced by cultural  conditions and 
                events, as well as by the participants in these events, during a span of  chronological 
                time. </p>
              I have  come to believe that the spirit world, as a whole, is not functionally uniform. 
All  spiritual   regions  are  seen   by  traveling  souls   as  having  the   same  ethereal 
properties,  but   with  different  applications.   As  an  illustration,   the  space  of 
orientation  for incoming souls could be contrasted to the space of life selection for 
those  who are leaving. Both involve life evaluations for souls in transit which  include 
scenes  from Earth, but there the resemblance ends. Orientation spaces are said to be 
small,  intimate conference areas designed to make a newly arrived soul comfortable, 
but  our mental attitude in this space can be somewhat defensive. This is because 
there  is the feeling we might have done better with life. A guide is always directly 
interacting  with us.
              <p>On  the other hand, when we enter the space of life selection, we are full of hope, promise,  and lofty expectations. Here souls are virtually alone, with their guides out 
of  sight, while evaluating new life options. This hectic, stimulating place is  described 
as  being much larger than other spiritual study areas. Case 22 considered it a  world 
unto  itself, where transcendent energy alters time to allow for planetary study.</p>

Generally, the people I work with are  still-incarnating younger souls. They may not clearly see  significant events too far into the future because the further away these souls  get from present probabilities, the higher the incidence of possible  alternative realities which cloud their images. Although the same  properties hold true for time 
              in the distant past, there is one exception. A  soul's own past lives are more easily 
                identified. This is because a single reality, with a definite course of  action, was 
                previously  established  to   train  this  soul,   and  thus  is   firmly  imprinted  on  his <br>

The same condition holds true for souls examining future  lives. Without knowing why, most people believe their life has a plan. Of course, they  are right. Although amnesia does prevent having full conscious knowledge of  this plan, the unconscious mind holds the key to spiritual memories of a general  blueprint of each life. The vehicle of life selection provides a kind of time machine for  souls, where they  see some alternative routes to the main road.

              <br>

Although they were a  loving young couple in the last life of my client, these parents evidently needed to experience the grief  of having a child they desperately wanted taken away from them. Experiencing the  anguish from this terrible loss gave the souls of these parents a deeper insight into  the effects of severing a blood bond. I will have an example of this theme in Case  27. </p>

One client told  me his last life was planned in advance to end at seven years  of age as an American Indian boy. He said, &quot;I was looking for a  short-burst lesson in humility and this life as a mistreated  starving half-breed was enough.&quot;</p>
              <p align="justify">Another,  more graphic example of a soul volunteering for a terrible assignment was that of one of my subjects who  elected in her last life to join (with three others of her soul group) the bodies of  Jewish women taken from Munich into the death camp at Dachau in 1941. All were  assigned to the same barracks (also prearranged) where my client died in 1943 at age  18 comforting the children and trying to help them survive. Her mission was  accomplished with courage. </p>
              <p>While events, race, culture, and geographic  location often appear to come first in the selection  process, they are not the most significant choices for the soul's next life. Aside  from all other considerations, incarnation comes down to souls making that  all-important decision of a specific body, and what can be learned by utilizing  the brain of a certain human being. The next chapter is devoted to an  analysis of why souls choose their bodies for various biological and  psychological reasons. </p>
