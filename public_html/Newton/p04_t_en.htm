These spirits  refuse to go home after physical death and often have  unpleasant influences on those of us who would like to finish out our own  human lives in peace. These displaced souls are sometimes falsely called &quot;demonic  spirits&quot; because they are accused of invading the minds of people with harmful  intent. The subject of negative Spirits has produced serious investigations in  the field of parapsychology. Unfortunately, this area of spirituality has also attracted  a fringe element of the unscrupulous associated with the occult, who prey on  the emotions of susceptible people. </p>

            <p>More often than not, these uncommon haunted  spirits are tied to a particular geographic location. Researchers  who have specialized in the phenomena of ghosts indicate those  disturbed entities are caught in a no-man's land between the lower astral  planes of Earth and the spirit world. From my own research, I don't believe these  souls are lost in space, nor are they demonic. They choose to remain within the  Earth plane after physical death for a time by their own volition due to  a high level of  discontent.  In  my  opinion,   they  are  damaged   souls  because  they   evidenceonfusion,  despair, and even hostility to such an extent they want their guides to stay away from them. We do  know a negative, displaced entity can be reached and handled by various means, such  as exorcism, to get them to stop interfering with human beings. Possessing  spirits can be persuaded to leave and eventually make a proper transition into the  spirit world. </p>

          <td colspan="2"><p align="justify">If we have a spirit world governed by order, with  guides who care about us, how can maladaptive souls who exert  negative energy upon incarnated beings be allowed to exist? One  explanation is that we still have free will, even in death. Another is that since  we   endure  so  many   upheavals  in  our physical   universe,  then  spiritual irregularities  and   deviations  from  the   normal  exodus  of   souls  ought  to  be anticipated  as well. Discarnate, unhappy spirits who trap themselves are possibly part  of a grand design. When they are ready, these souls will be taken by the hand away  from Earth's astral plane and guided to their proper place in the spirit world. <br>
            I turn now to the far more prevalent second type of disturbed soul.  These are souls who have been involved with evil acts. We should first  speculate if a soul can be considered culpable or guilt-free  when it occupied the offending criminal brain? Is the soul mind  or human ego responsible, or are they the same? Occasionally, a client will  say to me, &quot;I feel possessed by an inner force which tells me to do bad  things.&quot; There are mentally ill people who feel driven by  opposing forces of good and evil over which they believe they have  no control.</p>          </td>

However,  all souls are held accountable for their conduct in the bodies they occupy. <br>
<br>
We  will see in the next chapter how souls receive an initial review of their past  life 
with guides before moving on to join their friends. But what happens to souls  who 
have,  through their bodies, caused extreme suffering to another? If a soul is not 
capable  of ameliorating the most violent human urges in its host body, how is it held 
accountable  in afterlife? This brings up the issue of being sent to heaven or hell for 
good  and bad deeds because accountability has long been a part of our religious

The ancient Egyptians had an obsession with death and the world beyond the grave because, in  their cosmic pantheon, death explained life. The picture shows a newly deceased  man arriving in a place located between the land of the living and the kingdom of  the dead. He stands by a set of scales about to be judged for his past deeds on  Earth. </div></td>

A  crocodile-headed monster is crouched nearby with his mouth open, ready to  devour the heart if the man's wrongs outweigh the good he did  in life. Failure at the scales would end the existence of this  soul. </p>
            <p>I get quite a few comments from my clients about this picture. A  metaphysically oriented person would insist no one is denied entrance into the kingdom  of afterlife, regardless  of how unfavorably balanced the scales might be toward past conduct.

            <p>To answer this question, I should begin by  mentioning that a large segment of society believes all souls do not  go to the same place. More moderate theology no longer  stresses  the  idea   of hellfire  and  brimstone for sinners.  However,   many religious sects indicate a spiritual coexistence of  two mental states of good and evil.
              For  the &quot;bad&quot; soul there are ancient philosophical pronouncements  denoting a separation  from the God-Essence as a means of punishment after death. </p>
            <p>The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a source of religious belief thousands of  years older than  the Bible, describes the state of consciousness between lives (the Bardo) as a time when &quot;the evil we  have perpetrated projects us into spiritual separation.&quot; If the peoples of the East  believed in a special spiritual location for evil doers, was this idea similar to the concept of  purgatory in the Western world? </p>

            state of temporary banishment for sins of a minor nature against  humanity. The 
            Christian purgatory is supposed to be a place of atonement, isolation,  and suffering. 
            When all negative karma is removed, these souls are eventually allowed  into heaven. 
            On the other hand, souls committing major (deadly) sins are condemned to  hell 
            forever. <br>
          Does hell exist to permanently separate good  souls from bad ones? All my case work with the spirits of my  subjects has convinced me there is no residence of terrible suffering  for souls, except on Earth.

            having a monster waiting to devour our souls, we serve as our most  severe critic in 
            front of teacher-guides. This is why  karma is both just and merciful. With the help of our spiritual counselors and peers we decide on the  proper mode of justice for our conduct. </p>
            <p>Some  people who believe in reincarnation also think if negative souls do not learn their  lessons within a reasonable span of lives, they will be eliminated and replaced  by more willing souls. My subjects deny this premise.</p>

            <p>There is no set path of self-discovery designed  for all souls. As one subject told me, &quot;souls are  assigned to Earth for the duration of the war.&quot; This means souls are given  the time and opportunity to make changes for growth. Souls who continue to display  negative   attitudes  through  their   human  hosts  must   overcome  these difficulties  by continually making an effort to change. From what I have seen, no negative  karma remains attached to a soul who is willing to work during their many lives  on this planet. <br>

            <p>              It is an open question whether a soul should be  held entirely at fault for humanity's irrational, unsocialized,  and destructive acts. Souls must learn to cope in different ways  with each new human being assigned to them. The permanent identity of a soul  stamps the human mind with a distinctive character which is individual to that soul.  However, I find there is a strange dual nature between the soul mind and human  brain. I will discuss this concept further in later chapters, after the reader learns  more about the existence of souls in the spirit world. </p>
