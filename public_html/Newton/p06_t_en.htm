            <p>ALL souls, regardless of experience, eventually  arrive at a central port in the spirit world which I  call the staging area. I have said there are variations in the speed of soul  movement right after death, depending upon spiritual maturity. Once past the orientation  station there seems to be no further travel detours for anyone entering this  space of the spirit world. Apparently, large numbers of returning souls are conveyed  in a spiritual form of mass transit. </p>

Others are directed through by an unseen force which pulls them into  the staging area and then beyond to waiting entities. From what I am able to  determine, accompaniment by other entities depends upon the volition of one's guide.  In most cases haste is not an issue, but souls do not dawdle along on this leg  of their journey. The feelings we have along this path depend on our state of mind  after each life. </div></td>

                 <p>The assembly and transfer of souls really  involves two phases. The staging area is 
                   not an encampment space. Spirits are brought in, collected, and then projected  out 
                   to their proper final destinations. When I hear accounts of this  particular junction, I

                   terminal of a metropolitan airport which has the capacity to fly all of  us out in any 
                   direction. One of my clients described the staging area as resembling  &quot;the hub of a 
                   great wagon wheel, where we are transported from a center along the  spokes to our 
                   designated places.&quot; </p>

Another person called this area &quot;the Los    Angeles freeway without gridlock.&quot;  There may be other similar wheel hubs with freeway-type on and off ramps  in the spirit world, but each client considers their own route to and from this  center to be the only one. </p>

It is as if the soul is now traveling through the loosely-wound  arms of a mighty galactic cloud into a more unified celestial field.  While their spirits hover in the open arena of the staging area  preparing for further transport out to prescribed  spaces, I enjoy listening to the excitement in the voices of my subjects. They  are dazzled by an eternal world spread out before them and believe that somewhere  within lies the nucleus of creation. </p>

                 <p>Thought takes many forms. It is at this vantage  point in their return that souls begin to anticipate  meeting others who wait for them. A few of these companions may have  already been seen at the gateway, but most have not. Without exception, souls who  wish to contact each other, especially when on the move, do so by just thinking  of the entity they want. Suddenly, the individual called will appear in  the soul mind of the traveler. These telepathic communications by  the energy of all spiritual entities allow for a non-visual  affinity, while two energy forms who actually come near one another provide a more direct  connection.

I regularly  hear such water-words as currents and streams used to explain a flowing directional  movement, where a sky-word like cloud denotes a freedom of motion associated  with drifting. Visual images which call up expressions of energy mass and group  clusters to indicate souls themselves are especially popular. I have adopted some  of this spiritual language myself. </p>

                 <p><b>S:</b> (calming down) Yes, they are in their own  spaces with instruction going on. It's the directors  who move around mostly ... <br>
                   <br>

Even so, these souls are able to greet  the returning soul in a quiet fashion within the group setting. </p>

                 <p>The sense of a barrier between various groups, as  experienced by Case 15, has different versions among my  subjects, depending upon the age of the soul. I will have another  perspective about mobility in the next case. The average soul with a great  deal of basic work to do describes the separation of their group from others as  similar to being in different classrooms in the same schoolhouse. I have  also had clients who felt they were entirely separated in their  own schoolhouse. The analogy of spiritual schools directed by  teacher-guides is used so often by people under hypnosis that  it has become a habit for me to use the same terminology. </p>

There are always the  same six Elders in front of me who wear long white robes. Their faces are kindly,  and they evaluate my perceptions of the life I have just lived and how I could have  done better with my talents and what I did that was beneficial. I am freely allowed  to express my frustrations and desires. All the Elders are familiar to me, especially  two of them who address me more than the others and who look younger than  the rest. I think I can distinguish appearances which are male or female. Each has  a special aspect in the way they question me but they are honest and truthful,  and I am always treated fairly. I can hide nothing from them, but sometimes I  get lost when their thoughts are transmitted back and forth in the rapid  communication between them. When it is more than I can handle,  Veronica translates what they are saying about me, although I have  the feeling she does not tell me everything. Before I return to  Earth, they will want to see me a second time.&quot; </div></td>
