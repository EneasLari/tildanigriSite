              <br>
              It is a paradox that humans, alone of all creatures of the Earth, must  repress the fear of death in order to lead normal lives. Yet our biological instinct  never lets us forget this ultimate danger to our being. As we grow older, the specter  of death rises 
            in our consciousness. Even religious people fear death is the end of  personhood. Our greatest dread of death brings thoughts about the nothingness of death  which will end all associations with family and friends. Dying makes all our  earthly goals seem futile.</p>          </td>

              If death were the end of everything about us,  then life indeed would be meaningless. However, some  power within us enables humans to conceive of a hereafter and to sense a connection to a higher power and even an  eternal soul. If we do actually have a soul, then where does it go after death? Is there really some  sort of heaven full of intelligent spirits outside our physical universe? What does it  look like? What do we do when we get there? Is there a supreme being in charge of this  paradise? <br>
              These questions are as old as humankind itself and still remain a  mystery to most of us. </p>

            <p>The true answers to the mystery of life after  death remain locked behind a spiritual door for most  people. This is because we have built-in amnesia about our soul identity  which, on a conscious level, aids in the merging of the soul and human brain.  In   the  last  few   years the general public has  heard   about  people  who temporarily died and then  came back to life to tell about seeing a long tunnel, bright lights,  and even brief encounters with friendly spirits. But none of these accounts written  in the many books on reincarnation has ever given us anything more than a glimpse  of all there is to know about life after death. </p>

cognitive  restructuring with clients by helping them connect thoughts and emotions

            The case that opened the door to the spirit world for me was a middle-aged woman 
            who was an especially receptive hypnosis subject. She had been talking to me about 
            her feelings of loneliness and isolation in that delicate stage when a subject has 
            finished recalling their most recent past life. This unusual individual slipped into the 
            highest state of altered consciousness almost by herself. Without realizing I had 
            initiated an overly short command for this action, I suggested she go to the source of 
            her loss of companionship. At the same moment I inadvertently used one of the 
            trigger words to spiritual recall. I also asked if she had a specific <em>group</em> of friends 
          whom she missed. </p>          </td>

              After finishing with this client and reviewing  her tape recordings, I recognized that finding the  spirit world involved an extension of past life regression. There are many books  about past lives, but none I could find which told about our life as souls, or how  to properly access the spiritual recollections of people. I decided to do the research  myself and with practice I acquired greater skill in entering the spirit world  through my subjects. I also learned that finding their place in the spirit  world was far more meaningful to people than recounting  their former lives on Earth.</p>

We don't dream in chronological sequences nor hallucinate in a directed trance state. When subjects are placed in trance, their brain waves slow from the Beta wake state and continue to change vibration down past the meditative Alpha stage into various levels within the Theta range. Theta is hypnosis - not sleep. When we sleep we go to the final Delta state where messages from the brain are dropped into the subconscious and vented through our dreams. In Theta, however, the conscious mind is not unconscious, so we are able to receive as well as send messages with all memory channels open. </p>          </td>

I find this  generalization to be a false premise. In my work, I treat each case  as if I were hearing the information for the first time. If a subject were somehow  able to overcome hypnosis procedure and construct a deliberate fantasy about  the spirit world, or free-associate from pre-set ideas about their afterlife,  these responses would soon become inconsistent with my other case reports. </p>

One must have the right set of keys for specific doors.

When working in the spiritual realm, the  demands on a facilitator are higher than with past life recall. In trance, the  average subject tends to let his or her soul-mind wander while watching interesting  scenes unfold. My clients often want me to stop talking so they can detach  from reporting what they see and just enjoy their past experiences as souls.

              awakening my subjects, I often implant appropriate post-suggestion  memories. 
              Having a conscious knowledge of their soul life in the spirit world and  a history of

              energy for life. </p>

Whatever your persuasion, I hope you will  reflect' upon the implications for humanity if what my subjects have  to say about life after death is accurate. </p>
