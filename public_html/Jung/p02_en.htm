<p align="justify" class="style1">In the night the dead stood along the wall and cried:<br>
</p>
<p align="justify" class="style1">  We would have knowledge of god. Where is god? Is god dead?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      God is not dead. Now, as ever, he liveth. God is creatura, for he is something definite, and therefore distinct from the pleroma. God is quality of the pleroma, and everything which I said of creatura also is true concerning him.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      He is distinguished, however, from created beings through this, that he is more indefinite and indeterminable than they. He is less distinct than created beings, since the ground of his being is effective fullness. Only in so far as he is definite and distinct is he creatura, and in like measure is he the manifestation of the effective fullness of the pleroma.</p></td>

      <p align="justify" class="style1">Everthing which we do not distinguish falleth into the pleroma and is made void by its opposite. If, therefore, we do not distinguish god, effective fullness is for us extinguished.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover god is the pleroma itself, as likewise each smallest point in the created and uncreated is the pleroma itself.<br>
        <br>
        Effective void is the nature of the devil. God and devil are the first manifestations of nothingness, which we call the pleroma. It is indifferent whether the pleroma is or is not, since in everything it is balanced and void. Not so creatura. In so far as god and devil are creatura they do not extinguish each other, but stand one against the other as effective opposites. We need no proof of their existence. It is enough that we must always be speaking of them. Even if both were not, creatura, of its own essential distinctiveness, would forever distinguish them anew out of the pleroma.<br>
        <br>
        Everything that discrimination taketh out of the pleroma is a pair of opposites. <a href="javascript:;" class="la" onMouseOver="FF_showHideLayer('apDiv1','visible')">To god, therefore, always belongeth the devil.</a> </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">This inseparability is as close and, as your own life hath made you see, as indissoluble as the pleroma itself. Thus it is that both stand very close to the pleroma, in which all opposites are extinguished and joined.<br>
        <br>
        God and devil are distinguished by the qualities  fullness and emptiness, generation and destruction. EFFECTIVENESS is common to both. Effectiveness joineth them. Effectiveness, therefore, standeth above both; is a god above god, since in its effect it uniteth fullness and emptiness.<br>
        <br>
        This is a god whom ye knew not, for mankind forgot it. We name it by its name ABRAXAS. It is more indefinite still than god and devil.<br>
        <br>
        That god may be distinguished from it, we name god HELIOS or Sun.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">Abraxas is effect. Nothing standeth opposed to it but the ineffective; hence its effective nature freely unfoldeth itself. The ineffective is not, therefore resisteth not. Abraxas standeth above the sun and above the devil. It is improbable probability, unreal reality. Had the pleroma a being, Abraxas would be its manifestation. It is the effective itself, not any particular effect, but effect in general.<br>
          <br>
          It is unreal reality, because it hath no definite effect.<br>
          <br>
          It is also creatura, because it is distinct from the pleroma.<br>
          <br>
          The sun hath a definite effect, and so hath the devil. Wherefore do they appear to us more effective than indefinite Abraxas.<br>
          <br>
          It is force, duration, change.<br>
          <br>
          The dead now raised a great tumult, for they were Christians.</p>
