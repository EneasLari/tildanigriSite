  The world of the gods is made manifest in spirituality and in sexuality. <a href="../Kavafis/p12_t_en.htm" class="la">The celestial ones appear in spirituality, the earthly in sexuality.</a><br>
  <br>
  Spirituality conceiveth and embraceth. It is woman-like and therefore we call it MATER COELESTIS, the celestial mother. Sexuality engendereth and createth. It is man-like, and therefore we call it PHALLOS, the earthly father.<br>
  <br>
  The sexuality of man is more of the earth, the sexuality of woman is more of the spirit.<br>
  <br>
  The spirituality of man is more of heaven, it goeth to the greater.<br>
  <br>
  The spirituality of woman is more of the earth, it goeth to the smaller.<br>

    <td colspan="2" align="center" valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align="justify" class="style1"> Lying and devilish is the spirituality of the man which goeth to the smaller.<br>
<br>
Lying and devilish is the spirituality of the woman which goeth to the greater.<br>
<br>
Each must go to its own place.<br>
<br>
        Man and woman become devils one to the other when they divide not their spiritual ways, for the nature of the creatura is distinctiveness.<br>
        <br>
        The sexuality of man hath an earthward course, the sexuality of woman a spiritual. Man and woman become devils one to the other if they distinguish not their sexuality.<br>
        <br>
        Man shall know of the smaller, woman the greater.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Man shall distinguish himself both from spirituality and from sexuality. He shall call spirituality Mother, and set her between heaven and earth. He shall call sexuality Phallos, and set him between himself and earth. For the Mother and the Phallos are superhuman daemons which reveal the world of the gods. They are for us more effective than the gods, because they are closely akin to our own nature. Should ye not distinguish yourselves from sexuality and from spirituality, and not regard them as of a nature both above you and beyond, then are ye delivered over to them as qualities of the pleroma. Spirituality and sexuality are not your qualities, not things which ye possess and contain. But they possess and contain you; for they are powerful daemons, manifestations of the gods, and are, therefore, things which reach beyond you, existing in themselves. No man hath a spirituality unto himself, or a sexuality unto himself. But he standeth under the law of spirituality and of sexuality.<br>
        <br>
        No man, therefore, escapeth these daemons. Ye shall look upon them as daemons, and as a common task and danger, a common burden which life hath laid upon you. Thus is life for you also a common task and danger, as are the gods, and first of all terrible Abraxas.<br>
        <br>
        Man is weak, therefore is communion indispensable. If your communion be not under the sign of the Mother, then it is under the sign of the Phallos. No communion is suffering and sickness. Communion in everything is dismemberment and dissolution.<br>
        <br>
        Distinctiveness leadeth to singleness. Singleness is opposed to communion. But because of man's weakness over against the gods and daemons and their invincible law is communion needful. Therefore shall there be as much communion as is needful, not for man's sake, but because of the gods. The gods force you to communion. As much as they force you, so much is  communion needed, more is evil.<br>
        <br>
        In communion let every man submit to others, that communion be maintained; for ye need it.<br>
        <br>
        In singleness the one man shall be superior to the others, that every man may come to himself and avoid slavery.<br>
        <br>
        In communion there shall be continence.<br>
        <br>
        In singleness there shall be prodigality.<br>
        <br>
        Communion is depth.<br>
        <br>
        Singleness is height.<br>
        <br>
        Right measure in communion purifieth and preserveth.<br>
        <br>
        Right measure in singleness purifieth and increaseth.<br>
        <br>
        Communion giveth us warmth, singleness giveth us light.<br>
