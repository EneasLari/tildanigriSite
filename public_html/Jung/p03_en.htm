<p align="justify" class="style1">Like mists arising from a marsh, the dead came near and cried: Speak further unto us concerning the supreme god.<br>
    <br>
      <br>
  Hard to know is the deity of Abraxas. Its power is the greatest, because man perceiveth it not. From the sun he draweth the <em>summum bonum</em>; from the devil the <em>infinum malum</em>; but from Abraxas LIFE, altogether indefinite, the mother of good and evil.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Smaller and weaker life seemeth to be than the summum bonum; wherefore is it also hard to conceive that Abraxas transcendeth even the sun in power, who is himself the radiant source of all the force of life.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Abraxas is the sun, and at the same time the eternally sucking gorge of the void, the belittling and dismembering devil.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="style1">The power of Abraxas is twofold; but ye see it not, because for your eyes the warring opposites of this power are extinguished.<br>
        <br>
        What the god-sun speaketh is life.<br>
        <br>
        What the devil speaketh is death.<br>
        <br>
        But Abraxas speaketh that hallowed and accursed word which is life and death at the same time.<br>
        <br>
        Abraxas begetteth truth and lying, good and evil, light and darkness, in the same word and in the same act. Wherefore is Abraxas terrible.<br>
        <br>
        It is splendid as the lion in the instant he striketh down his victim.<br>
        <br>
        It is beautiful as a day of spring.<br>
        <br>
        It is the great Pan himself and also the small one.<br>
        <br>
        It is Priapos.<br>
          <br>
          It is the monster of the under-world, a thousand-armed polyp, coiled knot of winged serpents, frenzy.<br>
          <br>
          It is the hermaphrodite of the earliest beginning.<br>
          <br>
          It is the lord of the toads and frogs, which live in the water and go up on the land, whose chorus ascendeth at noon and at midnight.<br>
          <br>
          It is abundance that seeketh union with emptiness.<br>
          <br>
          It is holy begetting.<br>
          <br>
          It is love and love's murder.<br>
          <br>
          It is the saint and his betrayer.<br>
          <br>
          It is the brightest light of day and the darkest night of madness.<br>
          <br>
          To look upon it, is blindness.<br>
          <br>
          To know it, is sickness.<br>
          <br>
          To worship it, is death.<br>
          <br>
          To fear it, is wisdom.<br>
          <br>
          To resist it not, is redemption.<br>
          <br>
          God dwelleth behind the sun, the devil behind the night. What god bringeth forth out of the light the devil sucketh into the night. But Abraxas is the world, its becoming and its passing. Upon every gift that cometh from the god-sun the devil layeth his curse.<br>
          <br>
          Everything that ye entreat from the god-sun begetteth a deed of the devil.<br>
          <br>
          Everything that ye create with the god-sun giveth effective power to the devil.<br>
          <br>
          That is terrible Abraxas.<br>
          <br>
          It is the mightiest creature, and in it the creature is afraid of itself.<br>
          <br>
          It is the manifest opposition of creatura to the pleroma and its nothingness.<br>
          <br>
          It is the son's horror of the mother.<br>
          <br>
          It is the mother's love for the son.<br>
          <br>
          It is the delight of the earth and the cruelty of the heavens.<br>
          <br>
          Before its countenance man becometh like stone.<br>
          <br>
          Before it there is no question and no reply.<br>
          <br>
          It is the life of creatura.<br>
          <br>
          It is the operation of distinctiveness.<br>
          <br>
          It is the love of man.<br>
          <br>
          It is the speech of man.<br>
          <br>
          It is the appearance and the shadow of man.<br>
          <br>
          It is illusory reality.<br>
          <br>
          Now the dead howled and raged, for they were unperfected.</p>
