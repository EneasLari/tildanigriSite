              There  comes the moment, though, when the work of his evolution brings him to the point  of acquiring the inner certainty and understanding of the  Law of reincarnation or regeneration, meaning of successive incarnations of the soul, until its reunion in the divine Body.<em><strong><br>

This is the secret power, which keeps us close  to some people, regardless of the external events. He, who remembered, ceases  placing his relationships on a mental level; they do not constitute a subject  for study for him any more, but a source of life and light; they do not  constitute a link of security, but a link of mutuality. He accepts the gift of  the return of his beloved ones and does not waste a single moment.<br>

              Man is destined to create himself  through the oblivion of conscience, just as <strong><em>poetry creates on the basis of oblivion</em></strong>.  Oblivion is an unavoidable necessity, which the Universe has foreseen in order  to help man walk his path with greater ease and security.<br>
              <br>
When man goes through experiences of failure or  intense horror or pain, he develops a defensive attitude, which makes him avoid  any similar experience. The memory is &quot;cleared&quot; precisely in order to   spare man from such ties each time a new life starts. Nevertheless, there  are no few cases where subconsciously the denial of repeating the  experience is so powerful, that it acts without even mental &ndash; logical &ndash;  coherence. These are the well known phobias, which may have roots in one or  more previous incarnations.</p>
            <p>Lives that were stigmatized by losses, which mark  the rest of the way and cultivate insecurities within him; scenes from  unpleasant experiences in the distant past, which shadow his present effort to  walk in the Light; present sensitivities and fears, due to remnants from the cycles  in which the experience caused the trauma, will come back to memory in order that  he recognizes them and manages to eliminate them.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">
              <tr>
                <td><p><strong><em>a source of  ineffable</em></strong><em>,</em><br>
                  <strong><em>fragrant  memories is offered to me.</em></strong></p></td>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Man is freed as long as he manages  to return to painful experiences. Repetition makes him realize that pain gradually  lessens. In  that way he acquires power over any situation he previously considered  insurmountable and painful.<br>
              <br>
The loss of memory of previous  lives, which wipes out the marks of experience and gives the ability to create  new, &quot;clean and healthy&quot; associations is the most important opportunity given to man  so that he manages to efface wrong choices of previous incarnations and  invalidate their negative result.<br>
<br>
That is why man should not stir up  his old memory out of curiosity or coerce its recall. Memory returns little by  little, as long as man is released from the necessity of serving time in set life  patterns. That is why it is possible that images may return during the moment  of death-passage.<br>
        </p>

                  <strong><em>It counts and  changes the hours of the soul.</em></strong></p></td>

              The more man advances in Esoterism,  he realizes that  fear  has lost every power upon him now. This happens  because fear is unbreakably connected to the unknown. The unknown ceases to  exist as long as the eyes of the Soul start distinguishing the coherence of  Physical and Metaphysical Laws, the union of the known and unknown Dimensions  of Life, the Fullness of the World, and as long as man starts feeling the  Kinship with the divine Plan. The moment certainty floods over man, every fear  disappears, because everything acquires a meaning, everything is perfectly  settled, and thus it becomes clear that everything follows a course of  convergence towards the final realization of the will of God.<br>
              <br>
Moreover, we realize that the  events, the relationships and the bonds of the present incarnation are none  other than small tiles in a huge mosaic. The present incarnation, which we  perceive as final and eternal, in reality constitutes a simple &quot;passing&quot; through a  space, for specific reasons, in an &quot;instant&quot; of Eternal Time. </p>
            <p>We  no longer need to seek the reasons that have made us suffer in this earthly cycle.  Some are already known to us, but the most important is that there is no use in concerning ourselves with the past any longer. We look for the positive in any phase  of life we happen to be in, and  however difficult the problem we face may  be. We look for the good elements and when we find them, we focus on them,  consolidating our present in the way we have already structured it.<br>

              Just as the Prodigal Son left the  Father in order to get to know his self, in the same way the Soul detaches from  the Ethereal Planes and comes to Earth in order to get to know its self. It ties itself to Matter and tries its limits and endurance. And  at some point in time, after many wanderings &ndash; successive reincarnations &ndash; it returns to its  primary state having by then chosen this state. From the moment man has  consciously chosen this destination, he will face his life as a course towards  eternal Light.<br>
              <br>
              Remembrance is a gift and guide for  one to fit the pieces together, which otherwise have no meaning at all.</p>

              The man who has remembered, cuts  the earthly umbilical cord completely and opens  up to the World. He lives the Joy of Creation together with its Creator. He  forgets death, because the voice of Life is now echoing in his ears. </p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a28"></a>28</strong></span><strong>. </strong>The role of people is to  create and this means to transmute energies, according to their will, from non-conscious into conscious  ones. The recall of memory helps man understand the internal meaning of the  roles, which he has been called upon to interpret in his present incarnation  and completely disidentify with them, as he realizes that he is none other than  an impersonal co-worker in the Deed of God.<br>

              <strong><em><br>
              A Lagid, born only  yesterday</em>,</strong> meaning a  young soul in its initial incarnations, who is still an earthly material human, <strong><em>certainly  is unable to understand the pride of the Eminent Lady</em>,</strong> of the old soul  who has realized the inner meaning of its work. <strong><em>The wonderful lady </em></strong><em>&hellip;</em><strong><em> laughed </em></strong><em>&hellip;</em><strong><em> And was even pleased she could still be, in her old age, useful to Sparta</em>.</strong> The consciousness of non personification and non identification with the roles  life entrusts her with, makes her ready to resign from any earthly position  when the Deed demands it of her. She can also be <strong><em>useful</em></strong> from any position,  since she knows the only important thing : regardless of positions and roles, the  soul is alive and its word comes to fruition only when the spirit is committed  to the divine Deed. <br>
              <br>
              Gradually, man will divest even his  own people of the form of their role: he will feel them as souls who undertook  to play the role of his father, his mother, his companion etc. in his  present incarnation. <em>&quot;</em><strong><em>Holding the position of a merchant prince</em></strong><em>&quot;</em> and not &quot;was&quot; a merchant prince, the Poet writes when referring to the  profession of his father, phrasing his embraced knowledge on the notion of the  roles.<br>
              <br>
              So, we now have the opportunity to  heal ourselves, since we no longer confuse the love of humans with security.  Most of us have lived painful lives, that is why we seek power through the power  of love &ndash; but human feelings cannot achieve this. Only the Eternal and Absolute  Love of God can heal our old wounds. Let us turn to God and let us forgive the  people who cannot respond to our quest, without distancing ourselves feeling hurt,  because we do them harm. <br>
              <br>
              There are many people willing to  offer every single moment, and to them we should address ourselves when we ask for  something, and not those who cannot or do not want to offer us whatever we ask  at that specific moment. <em>This is the  biggest mistake that occurs in human relationships:</em> we ask from the one we,  ourselves have chosen, without having thought whether  he is  offering himself at that moment, instead of looking for the true offers that always exist  around us. This happens because we assign roles to people with air-tight and  fixed duties in our minds. In that way the role comes to the point of determining  our demands from the man and not  his real capabilities.<br>
              <br>
              The mistake pertaining to us is  that we connect a certain specific enjoyable activity or simple mood with only one  person, and we ask exclusively from that one, to cover our need. We must know  that nothing depends exclusively on one person or thing only, and feel free to  seek elsewhere whatever the &quot;source&quot;,    which we initially addressed,  temporarily  denies us. <br>
              <br>
              This helps us to neither oppress  other people nor our self who may possibly have demands because our needs are real.  Let us relieve   the congestion of pressing dependence in our minds, and let us  engage ourselves in discovering creative ways to please our self with the  certainty that the sources being offered to us are many and abundant. It is suffice  to experience this certainty within ourselves,  to deny the syndrome of deprivation,  which fear implants in our minds.<br>
              <br>
              Finally, these people, who  are trustworthy friends of ours in this  life, may appear in another one as tough and  strict instigators of difficult experiences for us. But then,  they will  still love us just the same, because they will have accepted to receive our  rejection in order for us to be able to learn the lessons that our path  demands. When we realize this, we will love &quot;enemies&quot; as closest and most  trustworthy friends and will facilitate their difficult task of becoming &quot;bad&quot;  for us in this earthly phase, because they sacrificed their love temporarily so  that we get to know our self.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a29"></a>29</strong></span><strong>. </strong>When the barrier of Time breaks and  Memory is awakened, man will return to the Sources, the ones he always had next  to him, which he read again and again without, however, seeing the obvious. He will turn  his sight to the great Masters of humanity, and the Initiations they gave to  mortal people in order to guide them to immortality.<br>
  <br>
  He will contemplate  how many  times he has read these very same texts, at some  time in the past when his ignorance  convinced him of his &quot;sure&quot; conclusions, when he was saying <em>&quot;</em><strong><em>I  read, I&nbsp; understood, I condemned</em></strong><em>&quot;</em>&nbsp; - like another <strong><em>empty-headed Julian</em>,</strong> who &quot;read, understood, condemned&quot;<strong>.</strong> But now he will admit to himself: <strong><em>You  read, but you didn't understand:</em></strong> because if he had truly understood, he  would not have condemned.<strong></strong></p>
            <p>So, he will return to <a href="../afos/Plato/index_en.htm" class="la">Plato ("Meno")</a> in order to find  Socrates&rsquo; knowledge again: &quot;...They say, therefore, that the human soul is  immortal, and at other times it reaches its end, and in that case they say that  it dies, whereas at times it is reborn, without ever being lost; they also say  that for this reason man should live his life according to the divine law as much  as possible. (&hellip;) </p>
            <p>Therefore, because the soul is  immortal and has been born many times, it has seen everything, both here and in  Hades, and there is nothing that it has not come across. Hence it is not at all  peculiar for it to be able to remember about virtue and about other things  which it previously knew. Therefore, because the nature of all things is  related, and the soul has known everything before, nothing prevents it, from  the moment it remembers just one thing &ndash; something people call learning &ndash; to discover  all the rest in the same way, if, of course, it is brave and does not get tired  of the quest; because the quest and learning is in general recollection.&quot; </p>
<p>He will even unite his  thinking with <a href="../afos/Pythagoras/index_en.htm" class="la">Pythagoras</a>, who knew that he had  lived before as Ephorvus and indeed he recognized, in some temple, his shield,  the one he had used as a warrior in Troy. He will associate this memory of  Pythagoras with the age-old   knowledge of the East: The Dalai Lama  reincarnates and since his childhood remembers and recognizes his personal  belongings, the ones he used in his previous life.</p>
            <p>He will also stop at Loucian to  reread from the first of his &quot;Mortuary Dialogues&quot;, Diogenes saying to Polydefkes:  &quot;I give you an order Polydefkes, when you quickly ascend (because it is your  turn, I believe, to live again tomorrow), if you see Menipus &hellip; tell him &hellip;&quot;. But  Empethokles' verse too: &quot;I was a young man, a young woman, a small tree, a  bird and a mute fish that jumped out of the sea&quot;, will acquire a new meaning  for him.</p>
<p>Neither will he omit  later bright souls like the one of Jordano Bruno, who sacrificed his life in  order not to renounce his truth: &quot;Because the soul is not met without a body,  but it is not a body either, it can be found inside a body or in another one,  and pass over from body to body&quot;. He will, however, also stand by the  positive mind of <a href="../afos/Pascal/index_en.htm" class="la">Pascal</a>, who sought truth through  Physics and Mathematics, and who asked himself: &quot;What reason have the atheists to say that we cannot rise from the  dead? What is more difficult,  to be born or to be reborn; that which has never been should be, or that which  has been should be again? Is it more difficult to come into existence than to  return to it? Habit makes the one appear easy to us; want of habit makes the other  impossible&hellip;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

His quest will reach its peak in  the Word, and the even greater worlds in which he will be brought by his  contact with the spirit that hid for so many centuries in the deeds and words  of Christ. Behind the Scriptures, <strong><em>remaining concealed for centuries, within such  a despairing silence</em></strong> or despairing garrulousness, Jesus <strong><em>how  gravely wounded he came to us!</em></strong><strong><em><br>

            <p>The interpretation of the Word will  continue as long as people exist on Earth. It will continue until we become <strong><em>initiated  and close friends of His</em></strong><em>,</em> until His Word floods the soul with relief and we find Unity, Power and Joy in it.  And as long as we are still <strong><em>ignorant</em>,</strong> in our effort to find the <strong><em>love</em> </strong><em>&quot;</em><strong><em>of Temethos</em></strong><em>&quot;</em><strong>,</strong> the <strong><em>beautiful  and worthy of Him</em>,</strong> we shall continue to read <em>&quot;</em><strong><em>Emonides</em></strong><em>&quot;</em> and ignore  what is really hidden within the written and unwritten <strong><em>verses</em></strong> of His High Poetry. </p>
            <p><strong><em>I appreciate the remarks of  great men more than their conclusions. Ingenious minds observe with accuracy  and safety. So when they set out the pros and cons of a matter we, ourselves,  are able to draw the conclusion. Why not them? they are going to ask me. Simply  because I do not have much confidence in the absolute value of a conclusion.  From these given facts I form a certain judgment while another person would  form a different one. Moreover it is possible for both of them to be  contradictory and both correct as far as each person is concerned, because they  are dictated by our particular circumstances and idiosyncrasies or comply with  them. With the above I do not</em> <em>mean to render the writers completely irresolute. Such a thing</em> <em>would be an exaggeration. I only want to say  that I do not love excessive dogmatism.</em></strong>            </p>
            <p>The role of truth may often be  ambiguous. Truth does not always help, when it is revealed prematurely, when it  is said with cruelty or even with the intention to hurt or belittle the person.  A violent revelation of the truth can lead to the opposite results, just like  sudden exposure to the sunlight for someone who comes from darkness can put his  vision in danger. After all, the role of the Master is not to make decisions for  people, but to guide them little by little to the Light.</p>
            <p>Jesus gave His teaching on many levels, touched  every single soul separately and opened the way freely for all kinds of  &quot;disciples&quot;. Most importantly: He gave all people the requisite time and the way so  as to learn to communicate with their self, to decipher its signs and  comprehend the needs of their soul, as they are  dictated by their  life cycles so far and present experiences. Then, they will not need any outwardly  imposed system of ideas, because they themselves will know much better than  anyone else what they should believe. Any inflexible system of &quot;faith&quot; can keep  man under &quot;discipline&quot; and in agreement with the &quot;moral principles&quot;, but it creates  characters which are far away from enlightened man. Every educational system  ought to create in people, the capabilities and competence to be able to judge  each time, by connecting with their higher self and in accordance with the  Universal circumstances, and of course not thoughtlessly repeating the same  pattern that they once happened to learn.
