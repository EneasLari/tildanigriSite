            <p><span class="style8"><strong>1</strong></span><strong>.<em> The  wonderful journey</em></strong><strong> </strong>of life, the <strong><em>long  road </em></strong>begins with the entrance of the soul within the <strong><em>Walls </em></strong>of the earthly dimension. The <strong><em>enormous, towering walls </em></strong>of loss,  namely the separation of the Soul from the divine One, rise <strong><em>imperceptibly</em></strong>,  with the soul's intangible penetration into the thick energy layers.<br>
              <br>
              With  man's incarnation, the essence of the soul - the internal Light of the  universe, the spiritual ether of cosmic Love - is confined. From then on the  soul's immediate vision and perceptiveness function through the limitations  imposed on the human consciousness: space, time,  material body, language and perceptiveness of the senses.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Incarnated man perceives the world only with the  conscious part of his self. All the knowledge the soul possessed when in the  spiritual plane, is shut in the superconscious. That is the reason man's inner  faith in the eternal and the imperishable thisness of his existence <strong><em>is  not habit</em>, <em>but instinct</em>. </strong>Even though man  has the feeling that <strong><em>from the world they shut him out</em></strong>, he knows instinctively that <strong><em>the celestine</em></strong><em> <strong>word</strong></em> sub-sists and is  predestined to be<strong> <em>added to life's imperfect sentence, otherwise nonsensical</em>.</strong><br>
              <br>
  <em>Faith</em> is none other than man's superconscious <em>knowledge</em> that life exists outside the  walls <em>also,</em> and his yearning to  reunite with this Life.<strong><em> To arrive there is your destination:</em></strong> the destination of the Return and the reunion, which is fulfilled on Earth  through the one-way street of Love. <br>
              <br>
              The limited overview that man has of the world, which  inevitably takes into consideration only what the Self perceives through its  conscious, is a determinant feeling for his existence:<br>

                <td><p><strong><em>And now I sit  here despairing. </em></strong><br>

            <p><br>
              Separated from the Self, earthly  man <strong><em>sits  here now despairing</em></strong>, inside the <strong><em>Walls</em></strong> of fear, pain and solitude. <strong><em>This  fate consumes his mind</em></strong><em>,</em> as he  tries to answer the riddle of Existence with a limited organ of understanding -  the mind &ndash; even though the mind constitutes his higher material body. Inside the <strong><em>enormous,  towering walls</em></strong> man does not know that his limitations are, at the same  time, the tools with which he will dig the tunnel of his escape from  Matter  to <strong><em>the  wonderful journey</em></strong> towards the Light, redemption and freedom. The  ulterior or inner aim of the whole earthly experience towards which the  universe guides man, is <strong><em>to build an immaterial, solid house, which  destiny does not shake</em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
Until, however, man acquires  insight into <strong><em>his destiny</em></strong>, until he is awakened from his material dream and  regains his lost cosmic Conscience, until he becomes <strong><em>wise</em>, <em>with</em> <em>so much experience </em></strong>and <strong><em>understands  what Ithacas</em></strong> (the many Ithacas) <strong><em>mean</em>, </strong>what he experiences is the  feeling of confusion. The <strong><em>confusion </em></strong>he feels in his conscience  &ndash; and which dominates throughout the largest part of his earthly course &ndash;  derives from the basic structural characteristic of his nature, his <em>duality:</em>&nbsp;<br>

            <p><a name="la_ty_2"></a>Conscience is  what   guides  Man's steps on this Earth. Conscience differentiates him from other beings,  which have a Soul, but do not have a Conscience,  that is why they function with the lower five or six energy centres. The  &quot;Crowning Touch&quot; of Creation &ndash; Man &ndash; as a symbol means exactly this: that Man  acquired the &quot;crowning&quot; seventh centre, the centre of Conscience, which can lead  him to the assimilation with God.<br>
              <br>
The stages of evolution are exactly  the ones that lead all species towards their initial form, which we can imagine  as dematerialization. This state of dematerialization, namely the total recall  to a plane of pure energy, is what  Men know as one side of their lives:  the Soul and the Spirit. On the other hand, they know  Matter, the Body and  everything tangible (even the senses, namely those they receive through the  organs of the senses or the emotions).<br>
<br>
This is the Nature of Man, what  Jesus meant by calling them Sons of God and Sons of Man: the Conscience of the  two, non homogeneous poles, of  Matter and of  Non Matter. This bipolarity  characterizes every situation Man perceives or experiences and cannot get away  from it, except only intellectually, meaning not substantially. It is only  natural and expected that man cannot understand exactly the concept of the One  &ndash; besides he is not asked to do so &ndash; his Conscience, though, knows that polarization  is not the initial and unique state. On the contrary, it is the state  subsequent to the initial unity, and the pre-stage leading back to the One.<br>
<br>
During the larger part of his  course, man is not aware of the transitory nature of his  existence, as he experiences it in this earthly world; he does not realise that  he will not be a &quot;human being&quot; forever, that his soul will not be incarnating  eternally in this specific functional structure of the being called &quot;human&quot;,  but that at some point in time, he will complete the cycle of his earthly incarnations  and will pass over to a next cycle of existence. That is why the <strong><em>dawn</em></strong> seems to him distant and <strong><em>improbable</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
Man yearns, therefore, for <strong><em>his soul&rsquo;s life </em></strong>not<strong><em> to come into being outside itself</em>,</strong> but <strong><em>within  it </em></strong>and<strong><em> with it</em></strong>. He yearns to ensure the state of being of the unity  he remembers, the <strong><em>improbable, exquisite dawn</em></strong> that his <strong><em>soul awaits</em>.</strong> This longing  for the Return, <strong><em>the inclination towards the sky</em></strong>, is the one that will lead him  to experience his real Existence.
<p><span class="style8"><strong>2</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Man's initially unconscious and  later conscious tendency towards Union is  commonly known as <em>Love</em>. Man expresses, in earthly  life, his tendency towards re-union with the God-Self, with the desire to  love and be loved. <br>
  <br>
The memory of perfect Love, as he  experienced it in the ethereal  planes, which is a state of &quot;being&quot; and not an  earthly feeling, has been held, vivid in his soul:<br>

              <tr>
                <td><p><strong><em>when, my  friends, I loved </em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>it was many  years ago</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>I lived not on  the same earth </em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>with the other  mortals </em></strong></p></td>

            <p>It seems impossible that such  ideal, divine Love has been acquired in our earthly world, yet only <strong><em>many  years ago</em></strong>, when man <strong><em>lived not on the same</em></strong><em> <strong>earth</strong></em> and was not <strong><em>mortal</em>.</strong> At the same time, however, divine Love is being  expressed as if it were known and experienced. Indeed, it is enough for someone  to take a look at a young child, in order to meet this divine Love, to see this  love's spark shine in its glance; because young children belong more to the  world of pure energy, where they come from, and less to the earthly world,  since the process of their in-materialization has not been completed yet. This  Love also emanates from the Poet, the one who re-coordinated his existence  with Its frequency and united his soul with the Self, having, however, run the  cycle of evolution beforehand.<br>
              <br>
Behind all intermediate desires man  is to fulfill in his life, behind all the intermediate earthly-material aims he  is to materialize, behind the unavoidable pain of ordeals, behind every  thought, word or deed, there exists the quest for the perfect and eternal love. <strong><em>As  he sets</em> <em>out on the way to Ithaca</em>,</strong> either being on the first cycle of lessons, hence keeping its memory faint  within himself, or <strong><em>sees the grass on the top of the rugged mountain</em>,</strong> hence he has  completely realized the truth, man seeks the lost Paradise of the Soul, where  he used to live before coming down to the material planes &ndash; <strong><em>from  which alas!, how wretchedly he fell.</em></strong><strong><em><br>

            <p><br>
              The fall, for the soul, is  equivalent to the loss of Light, loss of its highest divine-positive qualities,  which took place with its separation from the One &ndash; a situation that is called <em>Fear</em>.  If, therefore, this &quot;fall&quot; of energy is the course of the soul towards  condensing and polarization, in our overall passing through from the earthly  dimension we travel through a converse route: the evolution towards the fine,  spiritual, ethereal frequencies and the re-acquisition of our lost qualities.  This, in our life, is practically equivalent to the gradual transformation of  Fear into Love and this is the &quot;other earth&quot;, where the soul used<strong><em> to  live</em> <em>when it loved</em>.</strong><br>
              <br>
              Man, in the universe, is a channel  of Light, an <em>energy transformer</em> for  himself and  the others. Starting from his first incarnation as a human being,  from the non-conscious flow of energy and its low, instinctive transformation,  man will cover a vast course inside <strong><em>the walls</em></strong> of Matter, until he  reaches the complete realisation of this universal function; or in other words, until he  frees the pure soul that expresses the absolute Light from the fortress of  feelings and the labyrinth of the mind. </p>
In the  fringe of Perfection he will experience the greatness of the God-Man: having  completely spiritualized the earthly-material side of his existence, he will be  transforming the cosmic energy into Love whereas, at the same time, he will  have completed the cycle of his earthly incarnations. The <strong><em>improbable, exquisite dawn</em></strong> comes by experiencing the <strong><em>uninterrupted life</em>,</strong> the unification  of the conscious with the superconscious, the identification of knowledge to  faith, meaning the surpassing of duality and the reduction of the self  to the one Truth, the Unit, the One.</div></td>
