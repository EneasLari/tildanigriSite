            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a13"></a>13</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Man tastes the quintessence of his internal work, when he decides to experience the love Jesus spoke of:  the one that turns towards enemies as much as towards friends. Subconsciously,  we call an enemy someone who causes pain within our soul, without actually  having such an intention himself &ndash; even if he technically has the identity of one of our loved ones.<br>
              <br>
              This realization will bring man in  front of perhaps his biggest contradiction: he ascertains that while he was giving external and team struggles to &quot;change&quot; the world, to &quot;save&quot; it each  time from his supposed enemies, simultaneously, through a number of experiences  or lives, he mobilized all his powers to &quot;defeat&quot; him, to disarm a specific beloved  person of his, strangling love! <br>
<br>
He then focuses the struggle of  love on his &quot;enemies&quot;, those people that he, himself chose &ndash; parents, children, brothers and sisters, mates, friends &ndash; so that out of the shortage of love and   pain, they would guide him to redemption and happiness; because nobody is close  to us by chance. <br>
<br>
The particular people are in our lives at this moment, because this is necessary for our progress at this stage. When the circumstances do not allow us to get away easily, but we have the  impression that they &quot;bind&quot; us to a particular situation, then the message of  the Universe is that we can solve the problem and  break free from it for  good and all. Let us not be indignant when we cannot escape: on the contrary,  let us contemplate the opportunity that is  being offered to us, to relieve our  karma of a burden, and let us consider it as a sign that the Universe assesses  us  capable of handling this difficult issue.<br>
<br>
Each relationship is unique and  that is how we ought to deal with it.<br>
<br>
It is a great struggle in order to shake off the last trick of fear, which we unconsciously use in our  relationships, to change habits, long-established codes of behaviour and  reflective reactions, meaning  to divest ourselves of <strong><em>the  excellent suit of armour</em></strong><em>.</em><strong> </strong> <br>
<br>
In every experience of abandonment, rejection, betrayal, man undergoes a violent drawing of energy. The absorption of energy is a phenomenon of determinant force for the soul, loss of Light that  stigmatizes our life. But we have the need to go through it; the gaps, which it  leaves, become seeds for our further development. When we realize its value and  manage to transubstantiate it into internal power, we realize that the  absorption does not  leave a void only: it also leaves the roots, which will  lead to a new path of development.<br>
<br>
Love is a two-way interactive energy. The joining of energies consists of a two-way functioning. In his effort, therefore, to comprehend the problems in his relationships so as to heal his  wounds, he firstly seeks his own responsibility and recognizes how many times  he himself, for necessity reasons, violently drew energy from the other, by  transferring his fears to him.<br>

              <strong><em>The journey</em>,</strong> consequently, becomes <strong><em>wonderful</em></strong> when we try to extend our love to those who are weak and need it, and they are  the ones who unintentionally, or even selfishly, hurt us. The warrior of love,  even when he is hurt by love, uses the Word with honesty and courage and is not  afraid to express his truth to the other person, defying the &quot;benefits&quot; which sometimes  retreat seems to be bringing. For <strong><em>those who have committed and guard</em></strong><em> <strong>Thermopylae </strong></em>of love <strong><em>in their lives,</em></strong> no profit is acceptable, when it is the product  of cowardice.<br>

              Often in relationships, the accumulated tension makes communication difficult, sometimes impossible. <strong><em>Opposition  makes us more persistent</em></strong> and the pressure exerted by our material  words, makes confusion greater, burdens the situation with more upset and  anxiety, which chase the light even farther away. Therefore, it is advisable to  keep silent, when we feel that the other is not ready and we try to prepare him  internally, with prayer and silent revelation; the prayer is not only to God but  to Man as well.<br>
              <br>
              Our people are sensitive receivers  of our mental energy; they listen to our voice, even when it is silent,  and recognize it in the dark, like a lighthouse showing them the way of return. <strong><em>The  walls</em></strong> of the souls fall in the same way they were raised, without <strong><em>any  banging of builders or sound being heard</em>. </strong>Love is able to work  miracles, &quot;to remove mountains&quot; (The first letter of Paul to the Corinthians,  13:2), to erode the walls of fear, to beat the friction of the matter within ourselves. It is enough to quietly and noiselessly offer what exists abundantly in our  soul. Love always gives its fruits and souls find the path of Truth again.</p>

Help is offered to the  Higher Self, led directly towards it, and its results are important, even  though not showing on a human level.<br>
              <br>
              Energy is never lost, it is exactly  as much as we transmit and it remains in the overall Ego of the other person until its launching  from the lower layers becomes possible. All people perceive  the energy which our soul sends; if we continue, with faith and patience, one day we shall recognize the signs, which notify that the energy has  reached its destination.</p>

              Besides, now he knows, and that is  why he is more capable of tolerating what seems like an injustice to him. His  matter has become refined, selfishness has been weakened. And each time <strong><em>people</em></strong><em> <strong>implicate  him in their sufferings </strong></em>and <strong><em>temporary calamities </em></strong>which <strong><em>torment  them</em></strong>, his heart dictates him to escape from his self and become involved  in their problems and their obsessions, no matter how tiring it may seem to  him. He guides the light to where he judges wise and necessary. He is joyful  with joys, sad with sadness, he shares agony and pain. The nonchalance of that  one, who <strong><em>walked absent-mindedly and daydreaming, casting around a blind glance  of indifference</em>,</strong> is an effort to shake off the responsibilities and  obligations of the current incarnation. The work of creation is not elsewhere other than  the place where the less enlightened still suffer. God accepts every offer of grief for fellow human beings with exultation and honours those who offer themselves.<br>

              The  fear of abandonment is mainly the one which hems in our love towards other  people. Just as people connect the  feeling of earthly romantic love with the Union, likewise they connect human separation with death, and this hurts them,  while in reality it is none other than a space-time distancing.<br>
              <br>
The  fear of loss, in other words separation, is the primary feeling of the  detachment of the soul from the divine One, when it started the course of its  becoming conscious. It is, therefore, a primary memory, a feeling identified with  the thresholds of beingness and yet it concerns each soul separately while it moves towards  Re-union, so it is unjustly attributed to the  relationships with fellow human beings.<br>
<br>
Knowledge  counterbalances fear. That is why we must &quot;learn&quot; what we are scared of. Every  relationship and every experience brings us closer to our Self because it  banishes a part of our fear. And it is necessary that one loves a human being &ndash;  his greatest &quot;enemy&quot; &ndash; deeply and unconditionally because only when he fulfils Love with one of his fellow human  beings on Earth, will he manage to open his channels towards God and universal  Love. Man completes the course of evolution when he has loved the Created; and  only then does he become capable of trusting the Truth and loving his Creator. If he  does not experientiate the partial completely it is not possible to start his  expansion towards the Whole. &quot;For we know in part&quot; (The first letter of Paul to  the Corinthians, 13:9).<br>
<br>
That is the course for the conquest  of <em> unconditional love;</em> because even in the highest union of souls, we people lay conditions and we love as  long as these conditions are fulfilled.<br>

                <td><p><strong><em>My walls have finer  manners;</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>and they do not love  me for my gifts.</em></strong><br>

              The world around functions as a mirror of the world within ourselves; many masters have said this. It means that what  we produce internally is  &quot;projected&quot; as a reality surrounding our self.  The external conditions will always be adjusting to it.<br> 
            </p>
            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">
              <tr>
                <td><p><strong><em>The mirror does not  deceive me, the image is true</em></strong></p></td>

              Each time we feel that our mate  does not love us any more, this means that <em>we</em> have loved him under conditions, partially, and what we now receive, is the  realization of our previous transmissions. With each condition in our love,  even the seemingly innocent sentimental condition &quot;I love this person provided  he loves me too&quot;, we activate a simple mechanism: we put a barrier to our  emanation of emotions and we begin to distort it up to the point where at some  moment we receive it as a reality. That which we feel, the unpleasant  feeling which lies heavy on us, is the weakening of our own love. When this  happens, meaning when we do not love with fullness, then we feel as if  we are receiving the unpleasant feeling, whereas in reality we are transmitting  it.<br>
              <br>
The only solution is to produce love internally; to stop thinking with conditions and start working love without limitations within ourselves; suffice to lead our self to  feel, to experience what it wants  emotionally  &ndash; <strong><em>let us chant love and joy</em></strong> &ndash; and this  will be the right thing to do, the real action. Nobody can force us not to  produce the emotion we want. <br>
<br>
Through this internal course we  shall be guided to another kind of love, of higher quality and more impersonal;  because <em>we must</em><em> disidentify love with individuals</em>. The love  we diffuse into the world as an im-personal emotion, means understanding at  first, then  lack of evaluation and finally acceptance. This is  how we will internally touch a-pathy* as the distancing from feelings of rejection  and condemnation, which have as a result to deregulate our own vibrations and  demote us to a psychological state of turmoil and sorrow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<span class="notes">(* Apathy comes  from the Greek word &quot;apathia&quot; which consists of the prefix &quot;a&quot; which means no  and not, and the word &quot;pathos&quot; which means passion.) </span></p>
            <p>The more knowledge advances, the  more the sense of fear withdraws. Fear limits our point of view and instead of  broadening the horizons like knowledge does, it imprisons us into a forced  route. Knowledge is freedom because it renders man capable of advancing, choosing  and escaping from obligatory courses. For the man who has  reached that stage, <strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em> improbable, exquisite</em></strong><strong><em> dawn</em></strong> has occurred. The struggle has been won and the warrior of the Laws is rewarded  with the joy of seeing the results of love around him.<br>
              <br>
              This is the real <strong><em>excellent  suit of armour </em></strong>of true Power, the inner Power: unconditional love, the  one that alarms us so much, because we have learned to live without it. We do  not make this armour <strong><em>with words, with physiognomy and with  manners, </em></strong>but when we do not deny our self and our soul and we do not,  under any circumstance, flee from Love. <br>
              <br>
              Unconditional love - the only <strong><em>excellent  suit of armour </em></strong>- tears down everything fear accumulates as an alleged  shield; &quot;perfect love drives out fear&quot; (A´ John 4:18). It is the only <strong><em>ship</em>,</strong> the only <strong><em>way </em></strong>and chance for the  soul to break free from the <strong><em>walls</em></strong> of the loss. Then man resides in <strong><em>another earth</em>, <em>another sea</em>,</strong> since he  has created <strong><em>another city better than this one</em>, </strong>he can &quot;see a new heaven and a new earth, see the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of  heaven&quot; (John, Revelation, 21:1-4) and reside permanently in it. Then he is reunited into Love and no fear prevents him from feeling that he lives in the divine Body.</p>
