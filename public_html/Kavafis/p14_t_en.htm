              <a name="la_04"></a>The more a soul evolves in the  spiritual Hierarchy, its consciousness widens. The consciousness of those we  call Masters is so wide, that  it has now lost its &quot;individuality&quot; which we  lend to it.   Evolution of the soul is a course from the point towards infinity,  in the shape of an upside down pyramid. The pyramids which exist on Earth are  symbolic buildings, which depict this course reversely, wanting to show the  earthly course of man's recurring lives: the soul, initially a point in its immaterial  form, evolves on an earthly level going through successive experiences, and in  that way it extends its consciousness up to a point. That is why  earthly  pyramids &quot;open&quot; up to a certain point (base), the intersecting point with the  Earth, something that symbolically shows that the Earth by definition sets  limitations to the evolution towards infinity. Earthly life is in other words,  a phase, a stage of development. Afterwards, man separates from his earthly  material body and goes on to further levels. <br>
              <br>
The Masters who are working on  Earth, many of whom we know, confine themselves to certain ethereal shapes &ndash; <strong><em>the  Shadows of Love</em></strong> &ndash; so as to make it possible for the incarnated people to  &quot;recognize&quot; them and become able to communicate with them.<br>
<br>
            </p>
            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">

                <td><p><strong><em>When the amorous  glimmer of dawn embraces Thessaly,</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>vigour from the  life of gods</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>passes through its  atmosphere; and at times an ethereal</em></strong><br>

            <p><br>
              <br>
              The Master is an immense concentration  of energy that has acquired the capability of multiple consciousness. This  means that he can be &quot;conversing&quot; simultaneously in many dimensions, &quot;acting&quot; on  many levels of life,  i.e.  he has the capacity to &quot;be  present&quot; at the same time and consciously at many different points of the  Universe. The energy of a Master, always according to his Deed, expands more  and more, until it touches the point of Perfection, of God, of the &quot;omnipresent and all fulfilling&quot;  being.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              &nbsp; <br>
When we ask to communicate with a  Master, let us not consider that the conversation with one of the students means &ndash;  like on the earthly plane &ndash; exclusive occupation. Man is a very limited  consciousness: like a telephone device. The Master, in corresponding terms, is  a huge telephone exchange, with full control of communication of all individual  devices at the same time.<br>
<br>
Man can have awareness of only one of  the functions of his higher self each time, and rarely does he experience  simultaneous conscience. That is why it is very difficult to realize the  extent of the Master's consciousness. The disciple is called on to offer his self  as a means of realization of the divine Energy, even if he is not able to  understand the process. This hyper-coverage happens when the disciple is  capable of exercising such control on his self, so as to render himself a good,  becalmed channel. His ego will be well shackled and disarmed; otherwise such a  process may turn out to be a disharmonious transmission.</p>
Sometimes, of course, the hyper-coverage happens  unbeknown to man, so he himself, since he does not participate consciously, is also  safe. This, however, cannot happen often and easily, that is why the conscious  participation of the disciple is preferable. Then the energy can be better directed  towards the world, without forcing the free will of a particular person.
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a46"></a>47</strong></span><strong>. </strong>We are in the era of the  New Revelation. Let us trust the voice of the Masters, who so bounteously help  us and guide us. Their truths are omnipotent and concern us all. The Masters  can lead us only as long as our free will permits them to do so, that is why  we should fervently desire their presence in our life, we should invoke them,  we should leave our thinking blank for their voice to be imprinted there.<br>

              <br>
              The connection with the Source  means dialogue with the Masters and Guides, operative action without fear, but  having reduced them to the principles and the laws. Our Masters are constantly  present, guides and protectors, and see to it that the way  opens and that we see  it. They are here to neither judge us nor scold us, but to help us. They have  all gone through similar weaknesses, and know to recognize how difficult all  this is for us. They are &quot;meta-earthly&quot; people, who fight Evil and Disharmony, who  side with Eternal Light. This is not the only force, however. Evil is  trying to strengthen itself and its catalytic powers are closing in upon the  world. All those who wish to work with them against this Evil, are always in  contact with them, as well as with other individuals who act for the same  purpose. These are  now inside the Deed, because they requested it, they  chose it and were judged worthy of it; they never forget that the only  importance consists of the attainment of God's Plan for humanity.<br>

              Therefore, we should let  our heart   be a blank page where the words of God will be written down. Let us not allow  other elements to blacken the space that is destined to accept the divine light  and let us not shut our eyes to the way we ourselves have carved out. These <strong><em>ideal,  beloved voices</em></strong>, never silenced their truths from us, the earthly  people. Many times we hear their voice within ourselves giving light to our questions  and guiding us, without us realizing that it derives from them, since they remain unseen for all those who cannot yet see them on their own initiative.<br>

              When a Master wishes to talk to a  person, the phenomenon of hyper-coverage allows him to come directly in contact  with him through his language, just as  in every wider total   its sub-totals are contained. In  that way the Master &quot;identifying&quot; himself with the person, talks  to him as if it were the person's own voice.<br>

              The unfolding of events in our lives is to a  great extent due to Their mediation, as they are aware of the messages we bring to  this world, and our wider destiny. Their wish is to help us shorten and complete  our course auspiciously; because the disciple's victory is glory for the  master. Let us seek, therefore, their help, this graces their work, and let us not  worry if, for a while, they seem  far away from us.<br>
              <br>
Every  Master has undertaken some specific work that concerns one section, but this  happens only for reasons of modus operandi. The levels of the Hierarchy are  several and not necessarily valuated in rungs of superiority. Each one simply  covers some other sectors and corresponds to other needs. In reality,   Hierarchy does not consist of rungs and office, as a man may imagine, because  the consciousness of the Masters is broadened in width and levels so as to hyper-cover  the sectors of the work. When, therefore, we address a particular Master, it does not mean  that we exclude the communication with another one or others, and when a Master  communicates with us, this does not mean the absence of the rest of  them.</p>
            <p>                <a name="la_pa_3"></a>We  must comprehend that consciousness constantly widens to the Infinite, and the  Infinite is none other than another manifestation of the One and Whole. This  will help us comprehend that the evolution of the soul leads to its expansion  in the Infinite, i.e. its identification with the Absolute One, to  the unification with the Universe, its absorption inside the One Soul, God.</p>
            Just as the Unit which contains the whole  infinite system of numbers  within it, without it being altered qualitatively (1x1=1, 1:1=1), likewise God is inherent inside every creation of His, without this  constituting division of the Whole (1:1=1), and every creation is God himself  and not part of Him.

              From  now on the image of that past which we know, and for which we came back, begins  to be configured within us as we are able to remember a great deal, even from that old  life. That was the Paradise mentioned in the holy texts, and out of which the people were forced because of their greediness, in order to start their course from  the beginning again, by means of a hard and laborious road. By losing all traces from  the past, they named their old sovereigns gods. The &quot;gods&quot;,  however, did not  abandon them, and returned many times to offer them pieces of the Truth, so that they  find  the way of return again.<br>

              The Universal  White Brotherhood &ndash; <strong><em>the </em></strong><strong><em>invisible, secret company  that will suddenly, be heard passing by at midnight with exquisite music, with  voices &ndash; </em></strong>are  those old inhabitants of the Earth in the first years of its historical  existence. The planet was created from a thought-form of the will of the Sons  of God, who, through the Sun which constitutes an energy &quot;passage&quot;, were installed in this thisness of  material  dimension. On the same planet the Sons of Man were offered hospitality, and  about the era of Pisces it was bequeathed to them once and for all, together  with the capability of becoming able &ndash; if they evolve enough &ndash; to change over  to the ancestral Race of Gods. This was announced to them through the lips of  Jesus and was called Resurrection. From then on the choice of the course was  left to their own will. <br>
              <br>
At the present moment the Sons of  Man are at a critical point of their evolution, where their will should be  directed towards a higher awareness. </p>
For precisely this reason, many of the Gods return to the beloved Earth either as incarnated beings or as &quot;Voices&quot;. But also the souls,  which completed the first cycle of lives, return bodiless and guide those who  retrogress.<br>

              Three of Jesus' disciples &ndash; those  who were ready to experience the result of their own metamorphosis &ndash; saw the ethereal form of the Saviour and  heard His Voice.<br>
              <br>

 "... And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter to be with you forever -  the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept it, because it neither sees it nor knows it. But you know it, for it lives with you and will be in you.  I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.  Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.  On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you." (John, 14:15-24) <br>
 <br>
 Many times we have said that the  Truth is to be found beyond where the eyes see. And here now, our Science tells  us that the world is none other than the microcosm of the primary particles,  which we, of course, cannot see. It also tells us about a Universe with  dimensions which tend towards the infinite, gives us inconceivable numbers &ndash;  and  we still insist on asking for the verification of the Truth through our  senses, which the only thing they understand is the &quot;lie&quot;.<br>
                <br>
                Let us not seek Him, therefore, in  the world of  humans, because it is not about a person, but the very  Source of Light itself. He was born as a man in order to convey a trace  of the Truth to us. Even our scientists speak about the energy of Light, but we  refuse to believe Him, because our eyes do not see Him! But just think that  our eyes do not see electrical energy either, yet nobody dreamt of doubting it. <br>
                <br>
              Jesus, the Son of God, the one who  we once met on this Earth and believed conveys the words of the Father  to people, is everyone and the One, He stands here by our side in order to guide us  back to the Truth and the Light. It is the Power and its materialization,  that which existed and  that which exists for Ever. He, who hears His Voice is  inside His Body and knows that he is being fed with Eternal Truth. He does not  need to seek because he knows, he does not need to be persuaded because he  experiences. Let us follow Love,  allow our eyes to see beyond the Here and the Now, and He Himself will be our assistant in this. Let us forget the  limitations which people are used to setting  their selves, and  discover the New Life.<br>

              Together with Him we can beat every  moment that ties our thought down to troubled realities, with Him we can walk  along without anxiety about this or the other world, because we know that the  Truth is Eternal and Omnipotent. Let His Birth be a symbol of spiritual rebirth  and infusion of strength in our heart and let His Resurrection defeat every  idea of death within ourselves.<br>

He is always here because he is our  self.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a48"></a>49</strong></span><strong>. </strong>We saw that in order to hear the <strong><em>Voices </em></strong>and see the <strong><em>Shadows of Love</em></strong>, the Poet made external preparation (candle,  dim light, silence, reverie, suggestion, visualizing) but the preparation is  basically internal: communication with the other side is the result of a huge  course of evolution of a whole life or lives. Indicatively <a href="../afos/Pythagoras/index_en.htm" class="la">Pythagoras</a>, before safely  opening his existence to the invisible planes, completed his learning in Greece  and after that he was initiated in Egypt for 22 whole years!<br>
              <br>
The metaphysical quest, as far as  the cycle of life on Earth is concerned, must neither replace earthly life, nor  be used as an alibi for escaping. Besides, this quest has been entrusted only  to specific people, and again with the ultimate aim to be used in order to  facilitate life in its earthly frameworks.<br>
<br>
Therefore, even if man manages to  open up, to widen the ability to take in the truth, he must not forget that the  aim of his life lies only in this particular and specified present and he ought  to focus on this.<br>
<br>
In order for someone to pass from  intellect to intuition, he must have completed a cycle of self-awareness and outflanked  the level of earthly skillfulness and achievements. The Poet observes of himself: <strong><em>I  feel an extraordinary ability within me. I have a conviction that if I wanted,  I could become a great physician, or lawyer, or economist, or even an engineer</em>.</strong><br>
<br>
Besides now he can choose, and he  already knows that this is refuted by itself. That is why the metaphysical  quest begins with safety only when the physical quest has been completed and  conquered. An energy blockage is enough for someone to become the pawn of negative  emanations. An &quot;Achilles' heel&quot; &ndash; a fear &ndash; is as we know enough to disrupt the  whole existence.<br>
<br>

            <p><strong><em>From imagination to Paper. </em></strong>(Namely, from the subconscious, to the conscious).<strong><em> It  is a <u>difficult passage</u>, it is <u>dangerous waters</u>. The distance  seems short at first sight, but how long a journey it is, and how <u>harmful</u> at times to the ships which attempt it.</em></strong></p>

              The metaphysical edifice is neither built  arbitrarily nor constitutes an ungrounded theory without basis. It is firmly built  step by step, only on top of a solidly structured physical edifice. This  presupposes that personal matters have been resolved, emotion has been reduced  to the hyper-dense point of a-pathy and thought has exhausted its creative  capacities and courses.<br>

              Then, it is possible that man may  feel the existence of a being or beings, in the form of inner voices or a  vision, from the lower vibrational planes, given that the invisible world  contains the whole range of energy qualities, just like the earthly one.

Otherwise, <strong><em>the ideal, beloved</em></strong> <strong><em>voices</em></strong> will gradually turn into <strong><em>ideal suspicions</em></strong> and the divine  guidance into manipulation.

So, incarnated or non-incarnated entities, which harass us,  will not bother us in the future, if we will not absorb them. There is no way  to drive them back, simply let us not attract them. Let us not try to  understand why they approach us, let us try to understand why we draw them to  us, <strong><em>why  we carry them within our</em></strong><em> <strong>soul, why our soul sets them before us</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Until we realize our own need, we  shall keep on attracting them. The experience is repeated until the time of  awareness comes. The lessons are repeated as long as knowledge does not exist.  There is no way to understand it if we do not experience it directly.</p>

              <br>
When  the space is dominated by dark energy, this also permeates our own area. The  involvement with inferior energies demands double vigilance, constant and  uninterrupted connection with the Cosmic Source and strengthening which perhaps  we do not possess at the particular moment. We ought to reinforce our  resistance to the spiritual germs not only by strengthening our knowledge, but  also by avoiding exposing ourselves to unhealthy environments. A healthy  environment, with each and every possible meaning of the term, always has a reinforcing  effect. We are neither destined, nor ready, to cure the cancer of the soul; so,  let us restrict ourselves to isolating it or cutting it from the healthy body.<br>

              The  experiencing of emotions has deep roots in the unification with the Universal Soul. Just like clear water that goes through a pipe and cleans it, in the same  way Love &ndash; which is the synthesis of the positive feelings, just like white of  the colours &ndash; &quot;cleans&quot; the person through whom it flows. On  the contrary, just like acid burns up and destroys a pipe, the  same way negative feelings burn up and destroy firstly the person himself  who invokes them.<br>

              Illness is the manifestation of the  damage provoked by the conduction of negative forces. And even the switch cannot change a course traced out a long time ago. So, we see people  suffering with no reason &quot;obvious&quot; to us, because we do not have the  capability of knowing their overall course in the world. For them,  we must not think inquiringly only, but energetically we should urge them to  change course, so that at some time &ndash; a point in time which may  not be visible to us &ndash; the corruption  stops and the  regeneration  begins, the &quot;reformation&quot; of their  self, the rehabilitation into Harmony. Otherwise, they will be driven to  disintegration &ndash; but this is very difficult, because the tolerance and  strictness of the Universe leads to self-awareness and the &quot;return to  Paradise&quot;.<br>
              <br>
              It is really unlikely for someone  to be eventually driven to complete catastrophe because he is given many  opportunities. The most important of all, as we mentioned, is the loss of the memory  of previous lives. <br>
              <br>
              Jesus defeated death in people's  thinking, reminding us of the way of Eternity. Death is in effect only for  those who avoid the trial of life seven times. Then, they are transmuted and fall to the primary stages of life, because they  did not manage to gather the constructional materials to build a body of light within  themselves. This decomposition they undergo, takes away their consciousness,  which they may reacquire if they come to love life in their new course.  Synthesis is the distinguishing mark of the stages of development. Synthesis,  in other words clustering, is the convergence of powers of the impersonal Universe  around a centre of &quot;volition&quot; or &quot;will&quot;, as we know it, which constantly  expands, uniting itself with other like elements. The degree of evolution  determines the consciousness of this initial centre-pole as well, which from  one point onwards acquires an autonomous existence of its own free will, self-propelling  into space-time. That is why volition is such a sacred and inviolate  characteristic, because it constitutes the primary structural characteristic of  this core, which is also the threshold of creation. Love is the power that  moves the process of constant clustering and widening of the centre into one  body that tends towards infinity, to God. Love, omnipresent, reminds us of the  way of Unification, of Life, it separates us from the decomposition to which we  are led by splitting, death.<br>
              <br>
              When Christ appeared on Earth, the death of the Soul was the way for the people. The new Age, which lies ahead of  us, will open up wider horizons to Eternity, which will be justified by the  convergence of knowledge, insight and awareness.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a51"></a>52</strong></span><strong>. </strong>The spiritual person walks along a watertight  and fragile road. Because of his position in the Plan, he must necessarily move in two worlds, without essentially belonging to either of them. This creates a simultaneous overcharging of all the energy centres and  demands very strong resistances so as not to cause the destruction of the vessel. The &quot;pulses&quot; of his own vibration do not attune easily to the earthly environment; this makes him feel as if he is continuously swimming  against a current. This factor is what acts on him as fatigue or a negative mood  and lack of vigour. The fatigue he feels is due to the fact that his memory is active. Hyper-coverage  demands  completely different work, on a mental level, from the usual one;  this forces a person to be especially vigilant, and it also tires him.<br>
  <br>
He is, moreover, called to reconfirm  his desire from time to time; he is asked if his choice is still valid, through  painful exercises for the soul, because only he, himself is capable of affirming  whether the vessel is in readiness to face the hyper-functioning of the energy centres.</p>
            <p>However, he constantly moves forward without  allowing his self to be immobilized in the emotion of fear. Immobilization is  the real reason which creates the need for fear, because the way of knowledge  is tiring. &quot;There, where the light is brighter, the shadows are deeper&quot;, Goethe  wrote, but  <a href="../afos/Carl Jung/cover_en.htm" class="la">Jung</a> also expressed in his diary a corresponding situation of his  existence: &quot;The greater certainty is, the more superhuman the doubts are, the  catastrophic powers of hell.&quot;<br>

              People who &quot;do not believe in God&quot;  do so because they are afraid that their faith will hurt them and this makes  them His refusers. God knows that whoever is weak needs Him more and looks over  them, with the certainty that they will find Him one day, and will glorify His  name in the safety of His acceptance. Therefore, let us not accuse the ones  who do not believe in God, because they will find Him one day, the way we also found  Him.<br>
              <br>
The darkness of fear is densest just before the Light of Faith dawns on the horizon. <br>

We must not become disheartened when  we feel that we are being worn down by negative powers, because it is  natural and expected that as humans we are subjected to such trials. The faster  we leave them behind us, the easier we shall be able to maintain the  tranquility of God within us.</p>
            <p>Deep relaxation, even for a few minutes, recharges  our powers. The association with people, who &quot;transmit&quot; on a similar  wavelength, does so as well. (On the contrary, when we are around people, who detune us, let us see to &quot;closing&quot; our energy,   distancing from emotional or spiritual exchanges). Finally, the occupation with  the work we love, harmonizes us with the higher  universal vibrations, that is why it is therapeutic even when we think that we  are too tired to work. &ndash; <strong><em>And within art once more, I rest from its  very toil</em></strong>. Let us not follow rhythms other than the ones our self  indicates to us. Let us be attuned to our body, and listen to its messages.<br>

              And when the warrior is  found in the dilemma  about whether to keep everything he already has &ndash; which  indeed is not little &ndash; or obey the Voice of his Self, <strong><em>there comes to him an echo from above</em></strong> not to abandon the struggle and not to stop at the oasis, because the oasis  is not the final destination. To go out and confront the Desert, to go out on  the road, determined and sure that he will find the way to tame the north wind  or be saved from the bandits, when the time comes for it; he simply believes  that at the given  moment everything will be accomplished in the way that is best.</p>
            <p><a name="la_gr_2"></a>The Master renders his Voice to  free spirits, is talking to those who do not want to listen to him in order to hear  whatever pleases them.
