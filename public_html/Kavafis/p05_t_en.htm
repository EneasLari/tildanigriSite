            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a15"></a>15</strong></span><strong>. </strong>The evolution to Love, our  self-fulfillment, which is equivalent to the conquest of the divine equation  &quot;to love our fellow man as our self&quot;, passes through the pursuit of happiness.<br>
              <em><br>
              Desire</em> is the concept that produced man  himself and it is desire that he serves. Desire is what organizes the  structure of man himself so as he receives its materialization.</p>
            <p>The struggle for consolidation of personal bliss is  not a selfish effort, but a humanistic offering and service to fellow human  beings. Our happiness is not a &quot;provocation&quot; as some people are trying to  inculcate into us, but a prerequisite for offering; apart from pleasure, it also constitutes an obligation because it supplies  us with the necessary strength to provide support to all those who struggle and  suffer.<br>
                <br> 
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>  Your duty is to give in, always give in to the Desires which are the  most perfect creatures of the most perfect gods.<br>
</em></strong>            </p>
<p>Whoever lives happily, is the one  who walks the true Way, because the Plan for people is the choice of happiness.  The experience of happiness does not lead elsewhere but to earthly Life, and  he, who lives this life, will also be worthy of the Next one. All that which we seek,  all that which we dream of, do not belong to some other life, they already exist here,  and whoever finds them here, to him they also belong for eternity. <br> 
</p>
            <p><strong><em>Do not shut yourself inside  your house and delude yourself with theories on justice, with the superstitions  about reward held by an ill-made society. Do not say, my toil is worth So much,  and this is how much I'm due to enjoy. &nbsp;(&hellip;)</em></strong><em><br> 
              <strong></strong></em></p>
<p>Man in general has great power. If  he desires something strongly and decides its materialization, he can usually  achieve it, provided he starts from the activation of the idea on a spiritual  level: the creation of a thought-form. Then matter can obey any time,   for instance if the electrical installation has been completed, then turning on the  light is a matter of one second, by simply  pressing the switch.</p>
<p><a name="la_ty_2"></a>According to <a href="../afos/Lobsang Ramba/index_en.htm" class="la">Master Rampa</a>, controlled imagination, the one that knows how to create thought-forms, is the most  powerful force on earth and always wins the battle against the will. Anything,  which we effortlessly imagine we can do, we can indeed materialize,  regardless of how difficult or &quot;improbable&quot; our logic may be telling us it  is. On the contrary, anything our imagination is telling us is impossible for us is  indeed impossible, regardless of how hard our will is pressing us to do it.<br>
  <br>
Will by itself is a delusive force  and can bind man to earthly things. In fact, the contradiction between imagination  and will is the cause of many nervous disorders, because a person's effort to  subordinate his imagination to his will causes painful internal conflicts. The  man who has on his side imagination which convinces him of his capabilities,  proceeds in creating the necessary will, which urges him to materialize his  specific desire.<br>
<br>
He, who knows how to creatively  use and guide this immense force of his internal world, uses, directly and  naturally, the tool of visualization in order to connect with his heart. Then,  within himself he starts to &quot;hear&quot; the soundless voice of his Self, the Voice  of his Master, - <strong><em>in thought the mind hears it</em></strong> &ndash; which answers to his every  question concerning his course and guides him in his steps. </p>
The use of visualization in earthly practical life,  meaning the activation of the internal voice, was used by the Poet as  well, in order for him to re-discover the way already engraved by his Self in  the specific incarnation, concerning his work.<br>
<br>
<p><strong><em>I had two attributes. To make poems and write history. I didn't write History and it's too late now. Now you may say, how do I know that I could write history? I feel it. I experiment and ask myself. &quot;Cavafy, can you write a novel?&quot; Ten voices shout to me: no. I ask again: &quot;Cavafy, can you write theatre?&quot; Twenty five voices shout again: no. I ask again: &quot;Cavafy, can you write History?&quot; One hundred and twenty five voices tell me: you can.<br>
  <br> 
  </em></strong><br>
  Besides, work is whatever makes us  feel complete. The offer of work is important when it is  done in the area  which each one particularly loves, on the contrary, work may produce negative  energy when it is carried out with internal pressure, for reasons that are not  dictated by the Esoteric Teaching.</p>
<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a16"></a>16</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Our desires exist on an energy  level. Their materialization is a matter of light and this light exists within ourselves; it is up to us to project it: meaning to decide whatever we wish to  happen, whatever we believe will make us happy and move towards it.<br>
  <br>
Most times, however, man under his  current situation, even if it displeases him, <strong><em>feels safe</em></strong><em> /</em><strong><em> on board a ship in the port</em></strong>, fearing, deep inside, the consequences of change. So, he  himself blocks the materialization of his desire as it is possible that even  though he desires something, it may seem to him that its attainment will  confront him with bigger problems, so he avoids the materialization of his desire, out  of fear of the &quot;unknown&quot; future. And naturally, for as long as he sways between  his desire and his decision, refusing to choose, he remains a prisoner of the unhappiness   caused to him by indecisiveness or irresponsibility.<br>
<br>
At this stage, he knows so much, but  he still trusts people's words more, rather than his inner voice and asks  for the help of people who cannot see farther than he does. The environment or his  thoughts complicate the situation and try to lead him elsewhere, given the fact  that they reflect his inner confusion, they rekindle it. The others <strong><em>talk  a lot in order to persuade him</em></strong> and they usually do<strong><em> persuade</em></strong><em> <strong>him</strong></em> to change route, <strong><em>with their information mistaken  from beginning to end</em>, </strong>/<strong> <em>and with  their promises, and nonsense</em>. </strong><br>
<br>
How difficult faith is, especially  when people around nourish our fears with their words! At the same time,  nevertheless, these very people are excellent co-workers in our endeavour, since  they are training us to build our faith strong and impenetrable to doubts and  spies of thought. They teach us, in other words, that we will receive the answer  only from the Voice that lives within ourselves and assigns us the steps on the way  to the responsibility of creation. <br>
<br>
Then again at other times, we do  not stay firm to our desire because we become discouraged by the ordeals which  follow; while, on the contrary, the reason for the existence of  difficulties is to lead us to the reality of our wish, since we are not given  anything freely but only that which we have acquired through work. The result  of our work is not what we think it is, that is why we must work &ndash; not as it is  conventionally considered &ndash; humbly and without expectation, even when <strong><em>the  high seas seem disagreeable to us</em>,</strong> even when <strong><em>big clouds cover the sun</em>.</strong> Through the ordeals, no matter how <strong><em>arduous </em></strong>it may <strong><em>be</em>,</strong> we constantly reaffirm  our choice and we learn to act with calmness and balance, to keep calm and to  wait for the storm to abate in order to take the next step.<br>

                  <strong><em>It is arduous to  keep looking out night and day,</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>in the heat and  the cold, at the</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>Arachnaion for  fire. Now, the desired sign </em></strong><br>

              <br>
              Toil is always rewarded and love  brings love; provided we believe that <strong><em>the desired sign</em></strong> will <strong><em>appear:</em></strong>  that the time will come just as our eyes have seen it, our heart has desired it  and our mind has touched it. <strong><em>And we rejoice</em></strong> when the time comes  to reap the fruits of our deeds, like <strong><em>the Guard when He saw the Light, and our labour  also ceases</em>. </strong><br>
              <br>
              It also happens sometimes that we  abandon the direction we already have because we do not realize that all that  we desire, already exist in our lives. Instead of occupying ourselves with the  responsibility of developing them, we doubt our happiness and our ability to  maintain it.<br>

                <td><p><strong><em>I never found them again &ndash; those acquired completely by chance,</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>that I gave up so easily; &nbsp;</em></strong><br>

              &Iota;n the case of inertia, that is to say each time man quits his desire,  the beams of light he had radiated, instead of resulting in its material  shaping, dematerialize and he starts again from scratch, with a new wish.  Besides, until the final and definite Desire rises within us, this process of desires, <strong><em>that  we give up so easily</em>,</strong> by trying and constantly changing intermediary  earthly-material targets, repeats itself countless times during our course. </p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a17"></a>17</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Usually, the &quot;waiting&quot; period for  the materialization of a desire, does not in reality constitute waiting, but  time for inner evolution, since during its duration, man elaborates his desire  internally and its final form matures within him. When and for as long as the  materialization is delayed, it means that man has not formed his truth within  himself, and certainly it does not mean that it is an &quot;idle&quot; time and without any  other causality.<br>
  <br>
It is even possible that man may be  experiencing the feeling of impatience, because he has not taken into  consideration  that it is impossible for the materialization of a desire,  which probably concerns an entire  life plan, to happen directly and quickly.  If we take computers as an example, we will understand the procedure: the older  the model is, the slower it is in processing data, or in its memory, or in  printing. The more advanced the technology is, the more automatized the work  becomes.<br>
<br>
  No matter how far the mind, the intellect of some people has advanced,  the material body ranks us amongst the &quot;old technology&quot;. Some great masters had  the ability to overcome these boundaries and accelerate the processes: what we  then saw, meaning the &quot;miracles&quot; &ndash;<strong><em> the loyal gifts of the loyal Art</em></strong><em> &ndash;</em> was an immediate materialization of the desire through the power of thought.<br>
<br>
What is difficult for people,  in reality is untimely. Exactly the same thing, when the appropriate time  comes, becomes easy and simple. Difficulty, therefore, is not an inborn  quality, but the way man perceives that the right moment has not come, that time is  not enough.<br>
<br>
That, which seems far away to us, is  simply invisible.<br> 
</p>
            <p><strong><em>Could failure be a mistake  of Love? Perhaps the way was not very difficult, but it was Love that was very  weak&hellip; It seems that he, the frivolous one, thought his Love had inexhaustible  vitality, and just when he brought it round a bit, he abandoned it and he  looked another way, while that was exactly the moment when he should support  it, hold it tight, warm it, so the poor weak one would not faint again ...</em></strong><strong><em><br> 
            </em></strong></p>
<p>That is why it is important for man  to examine whether selfishness is involved in the materialization of his desire,  when the desire is compulsory, meaning the consequences which will result from  the activation of the whole procedure, are not taken into consideration. Then  man does not trust the Universe, its mechanisms and its harmony, but he focuses  exclusively on his desire and its satisfaction. <br>
  <br>
  Besides, how many times <strong><em>have  we not been deeply saddened</em></strong> for desires which <strong><em>some chance obstacle made futile </em></strong>or  for plans <strong><em>which somehow Destiny hastily came and stopped</em> &ndash; <em>in any case they would not have lasted long </em></strong>&ndash;  in order to realize, from then on, that &quot;failures&quot; which seemed inexplicable to  us, were necessary for our path to become solid and that they constituted luck  and universal favour.<br>

<table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">
  <tr>
                <td><p><strong><em>To be separated  wasn't their desire.</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>It was the circumstances.  &ndash; Or perhaps Destiny</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>had appeared as  an artist separating them now</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>before their  feeling fades, before Time changes them.</em></strong></p></td>

              Everything, in any case, serves the  general Life Plan, the <strong><em>great edifice of Progress</em>,</strong> the  attainment of God's Plan for humanity, and that is something which the sooner  we realize it, the better we will be able to direct our life in the right  direction.<br>
              <br>
The Way, apart from a  tendency towards inner analysis, also demands the undertaking of decisions. Decisions must not  be based on transient feelings, but on unchangeable principles. We often avoid  action because we are afraid of &quot;mistakes&quot; as a waste of time and energy,  something that it is not; on the contrary, it is an investment of creation. The  course is a causality in Nature, and  each time even a small step is of benefit. <br>
<br>
The inner attitude of Dimitrios  Saviour (160 &ndash; 150 BC) is the example:<br>

                      <strong><em>to end the  humiliation that had oppressed his country</em></strong><br>

            <p><br>
              Another notion that does not exist in the spiritual vocabulary is that of failure. &quot;Failure&quot;  shows that the time of maturation has not yet come. <strong><em>Deeds famous</em></strong> or not, we  continue to exist: each time that our expectation <strong><em>turns out wrong</em></strong>, our  course becomes independent from the conception but not from the Ideal. We  should not abandon the vibration offered to us by the energy of our struggle &ndash; <strong><em>all  this strength we have in our soul</em></strong> &ndash; but to continue our course, which  will show us the way.<br>
              <br>
Our  unfulfilled desires will bring us back to earth, asking to receive their  materialization. It is them that map out the route for our next  incarnations.<br>

              Nobody fails except if he stops  claiming what he desires or if he quits before he finds it. And of course, he  should not specify any &quot;ending&quot; for the path he has chosen as the most  beloved one, for <strong><em>his work he loves best </em></strong><em>/</em><strong> <em>that  he worked, touched with emotion and with the utmost care. </em></strong></p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a18"></a>18</strong></span><strong>. </strong>The shrinkage of desires  diminishes the powers of man's evolution and pins him down in stagnation.  Withdrawal from the desire for happiness &ndash; <strong><em>the Satrapy of the soul</em></strong> &ndash; is  devitalization that  leads one day to the final decomposition of the soul.<br>

              Demaratus, the king of Sparta, also  experienced another &quot;Satrapy&quot;, when his co-king, Kleomenes the First, conspired  with Leotihides, who finally succeeded Demaratus, and he <strong><em>shamelessly bribed the oracle
              </em></strong>at Delphi in order to achieve his  dethronement, with the accusation that he was not the true-born son of king  Ariston. <strong><em>Demaratus</em>, <em>to</em> <em>whom great injustice was done</em>, <em>surrendered</em></strong> to his fear. Fear is a  cancer of the soul which sometimes multiplies with our tolerance, because we do  not confront it directly and as a real rival. </p>
            <p>And <strong><em>when he had finally submitted, and decided </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> to live with resignation as a private citizen, (&hellip;) his misery peaked</em>.</strong> In that way, Demaratus came to betray his very own self, by betraying what he loved  the most. He took refuge in the Persian court, as a counselor to Darius the  First, and took part in the expedition of Xerxes the Second against Greece &hellip;<br>

              <strong><em>The subject</em></strong>, says the Poet, is <strong><em>the Character of Demaratus,</em></strong> as  behind a whole category of similar experiences, which attract characters like  Demaratus', the universe has &quot;hidden&quot; <em>the  message of independence</em>: man ought to claim whatever they deny him; he ought to protect his self and restore it whenever necessary. It is not asked of  him to be cruel and unjust, not even to grant justice, since this is being  organized by superior cosmic powers. He ought to be his self and to support  what he is with double meaning: by knowing its limits, every time conditions  try him, and by supporting this whole. He should not be afraid to confront  situations, because no power is stronger than the power of his self. <br>
              <br>
The man who walks in the eternal  Light, becomes strengthened through prayer and uses the mind in order to weaken  fear. He always knows what to do: when you reach out your hand, then you are  offered the warmth of the soul. When you offer what you would like to take,  then your heart is content. Whatever we expect, let it be that which we teach  with our lives. And those things which we did not solve, God will send to us again, in  order to help us solve them.</p>
And then, let us wait for the day when the struggle  has brought results, when the past has been defeated once and for all. Let us  believe in that day, and expect it, for it will come. </div></td>
