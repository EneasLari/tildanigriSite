The more someone approaches the moment and focuses on it, the more he misses  the overall plan, a tile of which is the particular moment. Certainly, every  plan has an ascending and evolutionary course and this is evident with  everything in nature. This, therefore, provides man with the certainty that all  the partials  finally compose a picture of beauty and  harmony, perfection and completeness and this  must be exactly the vision of faith.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Nobody asks us to employ psychological tricks of  self-deception, as for example the one of forcefully imposing &quot;optimism&quot;, but to use our mind in order to ensure practical  solutions to our problems, to search in life in order to find the bonds with  life. If faith seems a utopia to us, let us give it up. And when we quit and  seek the Truth of Life, we will then reach true Faith. Because Faith is the  End, and Life is the desire for Faith.<br>

              Let us listen  to the Voice, and let us demolish it, so as to discover his true Face each  time. Because whoever stays in faith, loses theTruth. &nbsp;<br>
              <br>
This  is the course that will lead us to <strong><em>grow virtuously in knowledge</em></strong>, meaning to realize that <em>everything  exists within ourselves and starts from there</em>. &nbsp;No other person or object offers us a &quot;unique&quot;  opportunity for a certain experience. Our Self is the Creator, because our Self  is God, and everything starts from there. Beauty, happiness, interest,  everything starts from us. Even if everything around us disappears, we, by  ourselves can create a Universe. This is the Creation of God, of the One, who  from within His Self alone, created the Universe out of nothing (no-thing). Man  creates his own universe in the likeness of God, initially through the way of self  knowledge.<br>
<br>
When  he is deprived of all the subsidiary elements, he will then realize the  essence of the Beginning out of the One. The One denotes the Unit <em>in*</em>  which (inside  which) the<em> uni-verse*</em>*  exists. The Soul is unable to realize this, if  it continues its way by &quot;leaning&quot; on things which are outside itself.  Through deprivation it finds its strength, it finds the unique way that leads  to the divine Creation. And there the Soul coincides with its Self. <br>
<br>
<em class="notes">(* In the Greek text the word <u>en</u> is used, which means both one  and inside.)<br>
(** The Greek word for universe is synban, deriving from the Greek words  syn + pan, which mean accordingly plus + everything.) </em></p>
            <p>Only  he who dares to divest his Self of all the elements with which he has &quot;built&quot;  it in the course of life, can reach the Truth.<br>
              <br>
              He, who divides successively, will himself manage to abolish matter, and face the a-tom*  (the element which Democritus defined as that which cannot be divided any  more). Then the <em>atom (he means the atom-person)</em> will  recognize its Self, which will not identify with anything from the partials, since they will have been abolished, but it will be that Power  which, having permeated them and by attracting them, makes them exist. Then the  Self will be the Creator who &quot;infused a breath into the soil&quot; and made  it His creation. This same Power can co-unite everything in infinite forms, but  only if and as long as it  knows that <em>it  does not identify</em> with these forms, does it become conscious of itself. And  only then can it remove its self-limitation and experience its freedom. For however  long the Creator &ndash; or the Creatress (Power) - <em>is identified</em> with, meaning it is self-defined as the created, creation stops, because the creating  Power is self-abolished, since it gives another name and content to its Self,  other than what it is. Then, it needs <em>to  be divided </em>indefinitely, so as to redefine  its <em>atom</em> character, namely its  separativeness from its creation. Then, it redefines its Self and the capability  of creation, which had been  temporarily lifted because of self-entrapment, comes again from within. And then, the  structural concepts of freedom, happiness, joy and creativity are re-defined.<br>
              <br>
              This is our Way, the Way of Being and not of Having. Our Universe can exist there,  where the limits of form are lifted.</p>
            <span class="notes"><em>(* Atomon in the Greek  text comes from the word a-tomon which means uncuttable, or indivisible,  something that cannot be divided any further. Atomon also means person.</em>)</span>            
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="la_pl_8" id="la_pl_8"></a>54</strong></span><strong>. </strong>By  following in the steps of God, man will manage to find the Self again. Just like  God, man can find the meaning of his existence in <em>Creation,</em> because he feels the need of self-realization and  self-definition, through something more  partial than himself.<br>
              &nbsp; </p>
            <strong><em>For this reason let us reflect on the futility of  human things, because this is a more articulate way to express what I called &quot;uselessness of the effort and contradiction  inherent in every human manifestation&quot;. Few characters, very few can &ndash; after  they accept it &ndash; act according to this principle, meaning to refrain  from every activity, except the one maintenance demands; most people must act;  and even though they produce futile things, <u>their inclination towards action  and their subordination to it are not futile, because they are a consequence of  nature or of their nature.</u> Their action produces deeds that can be divided  into two categories, deeds of immediate need and works of art. The poet performs  the second one. Given that human nature thirsts for beauty which manifests  itself in various forms &ndash; passionate love, order in his environment, landscape  &ndash; he serves a need. An aimless work and the shortness of human life can  denounce all this as futile; but because we do not know the relationship  between future life and present life, even this can possibly be doubted. But  delusion rests chiefly on this partial conception. The deed is not in vain if  we set the person aside and we pay attention to the man. Here death or at least  absolute death does not exist: the consequences are perhaps vast; here shortness  of life does not exist, but its vast duration. Therefore absolute futility vanishes:  at the most only relevant futility may remain for <u>the person</u>, but <u>when  the person dissociates himself from his deed </u>and only takes into account  the pleasure or the advantage it brought back for a few years and after that  its greatest significance for centuries and centuries, even this relative futility  disappears or greatly lessens.<br> 
            &nbsp;</em></strong>
            <p><a name="la_27"></a>The Poet's creation rests in the  deeper merging of the Word and Discourse (words).<br>
              <br>
              The Word constitutes the realization  of the Spirit, that is to say its manifested appearance, its materialization on a material level. It is  the Spirit that was breathed into Matter and gave life to it in the beginning  of Creation. Every man connects with the Word, meaning he becomes a  channel of the Spirit through the art or arts which concern the Word. When he  himself becomes the channel, then he communes, meaning he communicates this to other people. In this way, Art unites people by tuning them into a primary harmony.<br>
<br>
Discourse (words) as a partial,  secondary manifestation, does not accomplish the &quot;primary&quot; connection, but it  is used as the means for the manifestation of the Word. Talking provides the  material components for the Word so as to be manifested into matter, like  cells, bones and tissue provide the necessary elements for the body to be  structured, which constitutes the manifestation of the Form, the Image.</p>
The artist who uses the Word in his Art must be  able to open up, meaning to touch other planes by widening his own plane, so as  his human limits vanish and he is hyper-covered - without of course losing his identity &ndash; by the  Power of the Word, which is found everywhere in the whole of the Universe.<br>

              Ancient tragedy is as holy  and wide as the heart</em></strong> <strong><em>of the</em></strong> <strong><em>universe, </em></strong>because the creator of the great Poetry achieves with his <strong><em>holy  and wide heart</em></strong> to identify with the Creator who Made the world. That is  why his poetry was born in the earthly dimension, <strong><em>but straight away it flew, and set  the stage in heaven</em>, <em>where the  immortals were its audience.</em></strong><br>
              <br>
Perhaps we have wondered  about the different language people speak. We have surely understood that this  is a characteristic of the consciousnesses that have not been elevated to a  certain level.<br>
<br>
When the soul reaches and exceeds this  limit, it abandons this configurational particularity and  adjusts to a different kind of communication, without structural differences  from one man to another. Thinking always functions faster than  language,  and that is why we may realize that many times we have the intellectual  conception of a certain idea before it is expressed in words (vocabulary &ndash;  syntactic structure).<br>
<br>
The same language &quot;imposes&quot; the way of thinking on people of the specific linguistic environment, and this is a  characteristic that evaluates the whole nation, but at the same time,  the development  of the language shows the capacity of the nation to evolve.</p>
            <p><em><strong><br>
            </strong></em><strong><em>            We must study our language because we do not know  it. It has hidden treasures within it, and what treasures! Our concern must be  how we shall enrich it, how we shall bring to light what it hides within.</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p><br>
              <br>
              <a name="la_py_4"></a>The lifting of the limitations  imposed by the lingual differentiation leads to the universality of the  communication of beings.<em><strong><br>
            </strong></em><br>
Music, for instance, is given by  God to the people as one more means of approaching eternal Joy. Music, through  the most natural and perfect organ of vibration, man, becomes the bridge that unites  human consciousnesses which are cut off, on the earthly level, with their  Creator and Source. Harmony of music carries messages of certainty and hope to  the &quot;blind&quot; man, carries him to his &quot;homeland&quot;,  to the &quot;place&quot; where he comes from and where he will be again, tunes into the  vibration of Creation &ndash; what our ancient ancestors called &quot;catharsis&quot;. We  understand, therefore, how important it is for the Worker to clear his self  from the previous marks of death, in order to be able to partake of  the harmony of Life. <br>
<br>
The role of Art in general is of  great importance, because it gives the souls the capacity to touch the sense of  unity with their Homeland for a while. Inside it, therefore, exist therapeutic attributes,  as important as the ones of biological Medicine.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Workers of Art are Workers of Medicine, in its metaphysical sense, that is why it is very important that they are knowers of  the importance of their work. Sometimes invisible powers act through them, and  it is possible that their morals do not fall in line with their offering.  After all, the Created is cut off from the Creator and lives autonomously.  Certainly, it is possible for a creator's immorality to blemish a work, perhaps  even indelibly. In all cases, however, judgment does not befit people; they can  either be uplifted or not through a work, this is up to them.<br> 
&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><em><br>
              Very often the poet's work  does not have a fixed meaning: it is a suggestion; the ideas will be widened  by future generations or his contemporary readers.  </em></strong><strong><em><a href="../afos/Plato/index_en.htm" class="la">Plato</a>, said that poets  express great meanings without realizing it themselves.</em></strong></p>

              <a name="la_in" id="la_in"></a>Our voice is unique, just like the rest of our  existence. Our voice will appear when we are not expecting it and when we  decide to forget problems. Sound is sent from God for the people; we are only  the resonator, the instrument. It is suffice we take care of our self, in order  to become a clear channel and not hinder the voice of God by trying to control  it. And then, we have nothing else but to open  the channel of inspiration and let the divine element express itself, showing  trust in the natural function.<br>

              When we are able to open our self  to the Light totally, then we will be addressing the world. We certainly understand that the process of the breaking down of our self is among the  necessities for the attainment of the hyper-coverage process: the soul has healed  its Light, man has healed his Voice, since the Voice is the transformed Light  which God infused into man as Breath. The Poet transforms the Word into Poetry  and carries, through his Art, the Truth, because his Voice is heard by the  people: the Poet has become a spiritual Master.<br>

              <a name="la_01"></a>The experiencing of separativeness  is that situation which will lead man to the final realization of Unity with  the Universe and God. The strict differentiation as a sense of separativeness,  and the isolation within the narrow bounds of the schematized self, leads to the  road of internal discovery of those &quot;core&quot; characteristics, which expand to the  infinity of Existence. He, himself who lives in the vagueness of the space outside himself,  has no chances on the road of discovering the Truth. Only if we turn our eyes inwardly,  can we see where the paths of Knowledge begin and where they lead. Only when  the voices silence, can we hear the Voice. <br>
              <br>
The sense of separativeness makes  man discover the Unity with his Self, namely to differentiate the ones that belong to his own Unity from those that do not. In that way, he learns to  understand what it is that constitutes the similarity in essence. By learning  to recognize the affinity in a &ndash; small and limited &ndash; Whole, like man is, he can  later perceive the affinity in the wider Whole, which is the World,  another way  of considering it. By learning to distinguish every colour separately, he learns to  recognize the inner affinity of the colours and, in essence, their reduction in essence to  one archetypal quality. </p>
The same goes for emotions, as we said earlier.
<p><a name="la_pl_1"></a>Man will then be able to understand the concept of the Universe.</p>
            <p><a name="la_32"></a>Every cell in the human body is  &quot;soaked&quot; with man's personality, and no matter how vast the distances that  separate these cells are &ndash; proportionately &ndash;, they all &quot;know&quot; that they work  for the same volition, with a common goal and a common plan. The same too goes for  man, who can simultaneously be the whole but also every cell separately, he can  feel as a unit but also as an individual organ or member, and he has the power  to act as one, but he can also act separately and influence one cell or a group  of cells (just as, for instance, in the case of the self-cure of cancer). And  inside this &ndash; human &ndash; being, you cannot locate where it is exactly and what  exactly it is that gives the identity and the &quot;face&quot; to man, because this  exists in every partial segment, but at the same time nowhere in a tangible way.<br>
              <br>
If we contemplate this truth, we may be able to better comprehend the concept of  God. Because man was created in the image of God and is evolving in His  likeness. Man inside God's Body is the cell which has the same volition as the  One, but acts in an organized way in the Whole and at the same time is entrusted  with a different life plan.<br>
<br>
God is the One and the Whole, the actually Existent Being. The Being is the  Universe, which was born from the Unit, just like the fetus is born from  the Unit and grows out of its inner powers, or in other words, it expands in Time-Space.</p>
Man's History can be sought in the history of the  natural Universe or the biological cell. Because the cell retains in its memory  the knowledge of the truth of its origin and its course, as well as of its &quot;identity&quot;, just  like man.

Let us calm our  insecurity; our way is straight and clear-cut. Let us not be afraid to rejoice, because  the new joy is a divine gift which belongs to Eternity.

However, the most important  thing is that from now on he can distinguish strictness from <strong><em>foolish  revenge</em></strong>. <strong><em>If your judgment is strict</em></strong>,<strong> </strong>goddess Athena says to the mortal humans,<strong> <em>let it be clear as well &ndash; spotless  like a diamond, pure</em>.<br>
<br> 
</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>Great power &quot;</em></strong><strong><em>the poetry that forgives&quot;! Poetry, which alone gives immortality &ndash; true, wide, unshakable  immortality &ndash; and understands the truth more correctly because it thinks &ndash; if I  may use this expression &ndash; through the heart.</em></strong></p>
            <p><br>
              <br>
              Strictness is a personal attitude, it concerns the person who adopts it, and has nothing to do with those towards whom it is &quot;addressed&quot;. Namely, a person is either strict or not <em>in general</em>, and cannot be strict in one certain direction only, because then there is a lie somewhere. Strictness is principally a behaviour towards the very self. Showing strictness means not  deviating from your position, provided it is composed and represents an  essential message. It means an unswerving, systematic and organized stance in life, it means for someone to accept and apply the Laws according to the  level to which he has come to understand them, it means knowledge and critical  ability. If the above do not exist, then we are not talking about strictness  but selfishness and sometimes wickedness, which is manifested as  lack of  understanding or willingness to understand, as heartlessness,  and surely it is very far from co-ordinating with the Laws.<br>
              <br>
              Consequently, strictness &ndash; towards our self &ndash; is a notion identical to  leniency &ndash; towards others &ndash; something which surely does not mean concession.  Often, conceding shows fear of loss and effort to redeem certainty. So,  concession means consent to stagnation: through strictness we must let the  others &quot;earn&quot; what they  desire. This does not imply any kind of vindictive spirit, but  has to do  with their freedom.<br>
              <br>
              No matter how much  we may know the Good and the Truth in some given moment, we cannot and  must not consider that it is equally self understood by the others too, and enter  the process of expecting it from them or punishing them because they did not manifest  it. Neither this, nor their assessment belongs to our jurisdiction. We can only  try to point it out and this as a basis means to accept and admit their freedom  to find it or not. Otherwise, it is as if for instance we want to show how bad  it is to take lives, by killing people.<br>
              <br>
              Strictness  naturally has nothing to do with negative feelings, such as wickedness,  contempt of man, sense of imposition, and so forth, because it only denotes  that man has discovered the Truth, has attuned to it, without  deviating at all, so then he feels calm, secure and joyful. In this situation,  he can feel nothing other than being flooded with love towards everybody and  everything, understanding and the willingness to forgive. Being certain himself  that he is on the side of the Truth, he emanates this certainty to those around  him, and does not have any inclination to force them in any way to  also see it, just as when one day we are bathed in the bright Sun by the sea and we are  not in anguish - we do not even  think &ndash; of trying to convince the ones next to us, that we are all experiencing  a sun-kissed morning. </p>
When things are not that self-evident, then we  firstly examine our self, in order to become certain that our strictness is  indeed siding with the Truth and not an intention to impose ourselves (with  the aim to draw energy violently from the others, etc.). Afterwards we continue  our course without &quot;warnings&quot;, &quot;threats&quot; or other such like, and of course  without consuming ourselves in convincing the others of what we are doing. It must  be completely clear in our minds the sense that strictness concerns our self  only, so it is not a behaviour  towards others, does not manifest itself with words, let alone violent and  pressing or apologetic ones, and most important, it cannot be accompanied  by negative or anguished feelings.<br>

              So,  let us therefore remember that what we ought to show the weaker people is  stability, decisiveness, and leniency, and &quot;guide&quot; them with our steps. Let us stay in strictness without withdrawal. The weak ones appreciate what they are scared of. The strong ones respect what they appreciate. Our self, however, must be  kept humble, mild and full of kindness for our fellow human beings.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a56"></a>57</strong></span><strong>. </strong><em>Humbleness</em> is power and not weakness or  &quot;victimization&quot;, as many people say. The strong one, he who has sided with the  Good and the Eternal, never feels insecurity or fear. He, who knows his Self  knows God, and this gives him the extensiveness of the Universe and the density  of the point; that is why he does not feel uncertainty, because he knows the true Existence and experiences it. He, who experiences Unity, does not worry  about the separativeness of the Partial, but he sees convergence everywhere.<br>
  <br>
He who possesses the Knowledge and experiences the Truth is strong. He understands the past and forethinks the future, living at the same time fully in the  present. Let us not forget that the future is none other than an extension of  perception, and whoever has clear eyes can enter this state.<br>
<br>
This man knows that he is subject  to the Causality of Nature. He does not have the need to hyper-raise his self, because he knows it. Most importantly, however, he has no need to  &quot;convince&quot; his self, because he experiences. Non-experiencing is perceived by the person as separativeness, since he knows on the one hand the &quot;right&quot; state,  intellectually, but at the same time he is outside it as regards its realization. So bipolarity, splitting, is created, and this is the beginning of man&rsquo;s anguish, the downfall from the One, the experiencing of  separativeness, by extension, of solitude. The concept of solitude denotes that existence  experiences an anti-thesis with something else, an object opposite it. The realization of separativeness  causes pain, because it is a situation different from the very nature of the  Soul, which is born in the absolute Unity and identification with the Universe. <br>
<br>
Therefore we understand that the  sense and mainly the experiencing of Unity creates power, whereas splitting  creates weakness. Fear is the emotion which sets into motion the process of the effort to return to the primary unity through the realization (experiencing) of  the splitting. Therefore, he, who is afraid of solitude, is the one who starts  from it, in order to return to the primary unity.</p>
He, who is at this point, differentiates his self from  those surrounding him, and persists in differentiation &ndash; without seeing that in  this way he preserves the situation of separativeness within himself, which later  places him in the vicious circle of fear. On the contrary, he, who is really  strong, meaning identified with the God-Self, he himself does not need to hyper-raise and  differentiate himself, so he is really humble.<br>

              Humbleness means being just as  divine as human, just as great as small, just as equal to God as to the ant; to  appreciate, admire and elevate your self so much as to become humble like a simple  leaf, like a sunray, like a wave, things simple and humble, but also  irreplaceable and wonderful. Who can create a leaf? Who can allege that it is not  something perfect and admirable? Who can despise it? <br>
              </p>
            <p>The really humble man &ndash; <strong><em>he  who keeps the proper faith</em></strong> - has been reduced to a-pathy, in the sense of  the condensing of feelings into the hyperdense point of Love that identifies  with the One. From the moment he decided to follow the Way consciously, he  knows that not only has the deterministic progress of facts departed from his  own will, but also that there is no possibility of deviation in the result.</p>
            <p><a name="la_ed_2"></a>The more we trust, the wider the  way opens up in front of us.<br>
  <br>
Faith must be strong for whatever is distant and invisible. Man  ought to know the Ethereal and the Eternal, touch it with the Spirit, even when  he cannot conquer it.<br>

              In olden times they used to speak  of magicians who had the power to create storms, tempests, who could defeat  nature and subordinate it to their will. Such &quot;magicians&quot; also exist today, and  they are none other than the people whose spiritual power is exceptionally great. Provided, of course, they do  not become &quot;sorcerer's apprentices&quot; &hellip; But still even this is  a necessary stage  in order to realize how they ought to handle Power.<br>
              <br>
              Man must not put himself in violation  of the law of balance on this Earth. Then, his will incites the lower powers  towards him, because they are being violated by a will which does not obey them  but forces of other worlds.<br>
              <br>
              Let us consider, though, that  at times Power led other people to the cure of  difficult diseases. So, if this happens, let us not feel remorse. The results  are visible in Matter, and this is finally what we want to achieve and confirm.  We must reach this conclusion by ourselves, we must conquer it, because no matter how much it appears in words, it does not become finalized. And the finalization of  Faith is indeed on our way.<br>
              <br>
              The more the power of the  conscience increases, the more the obedience of matter   intensifies. In fact, the more he believes in it, the more it will become strengthened.  His position is consolidated and this fortifies his will; this means that his  contribution is from then on indispensable and his responsibility also great.<br>

            <p><a name="la_35"></a>There will come a time  when he realizes  once and for all the importance of inner power. &nbsp;<br>
                <br>
  Power is the ability  to  converge the interspersed forces, which exist all around in nature, in a  specific direction and activate them towards some specific purpose. The personal  consumption is intense, that is why he must be connected to the Source in order  to bear the weight of this action. This in fact is the distinctive  characteristic: when the action is in accordance with the Plan, then the connection  is made automatically and the deed is completed. When the action contravenes the  Plan, then connection is not successful, therefore the whole effort of the  person who acts fails. In this way, he understands that everything that was not accomplished, was different from what ought to have been done. So, his  power is not negated, which in any case has been bestowed on him by God himself  and he ought to consider it present beyond any doubt.</p>
            That is why he must neither self-doubt, nor evaluate  his self because his judgment cannot be formed when the knowledge is not  accurate and complete. Not everybody can have the same power, this is natural,  and it does not correspond to the mental level or the level of the soul of each  person, but to the chapter of life he is going through.
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a57"></a>58</strong></span><strong>. </strong>The contribution of the spiritual  man is especially important in the evolution of this world, since the motion  is not always pre-decided and the counterbalancing forces are powerful.<br>
  <br>
  It is not necessary for the  spiritual man to direct his thought specifically and systematically in one  direction in order for it to take effect. Of course, sometimes this happens  because there is a certain specific incident that calls for immediate assistance.  However, more generally, the emission of luminous energy in all directions is  equally important for the surrounding world. In these cases man still radiates  even while he is in a situation of conscience resting. This radiation is  absorbed by the receivers who accept the specific band of the spectrum of  radiation and are always enhanced without the  transmitter being aware of it.<br>
<br>
That is why it is especially  important for the world that we are in a condition  of bliss and joy, because in this way we become &quot;transmitters&quot; of divine  energy, the one which we enjoy at that moment, being connected with the Highest  Source.</p>
The contribution of spiritual people is invaluable,  even if their power in this specific world seems non-existent or, at least, weak.  This happens because we, people, have limited overview of the world and we only  take the things we realize with the senses into consideration. Spiritual  man has intense activity on levels higher than the perceptibility of our senses  and its results, often become visible with much difficulty. However, the powers  which are activated in other dimensions are very powerful and we ought to respect  them, even if it is impossible to perceive either them or their results.<br>

              This is the true meaning of life  and let us not seek it in places where we have perception, because most of the time  it is not visible. When we truly love this life, then we will realize for  good and all that we can carry the bliss of the ethereal to the earthly life  and this will also set an example for those  around us. This was the gift of Birth and Resurrection, the unification of the  earthly time with the cosmic time-less. The road to deification also exists in  the very world we live in. If we achieve its discovery, we will not need to  leave again in order to encounter it, we will install it in our world and will transmutate  every disharmony into movement of life.</p>
This life of ours is not a coercion; it  is an offering of assistance to the lower levels of life, a transformation of barren  ground into fertile.<br>

              He is with us too, together  with all those who call  His name, He sympathizes with us and helps every  effort, because cosmic life will never function properly as long as even a  small part of the total, lives in disharmony. He knows that we are struggling  against prejudice, connotations of the past and the ideas of others, He knows  that the struggle against &quot;reality&quot; is dreadful. He also knows that  the situation prevailing on Earth is ominous, and we rightly  wonder about the future. We must, however, remember that whatever we consider  impossible, this is subject to the will of God.<br>
              <br>
Let us believe in His light  and love, in the power His name has, and we will transform the world. Let us  not cry any longer, because the Mantle of His Light covers us, because He knows  that our heart is sensitive. When directed thinking tires us, we can let  ourselves connect with His Body, while our mind is resting, and then the offering  will be equally important because He will be the one acting.<br>
<br>
Not everybody's struggle is  the same. Personal struggle is necessary for warriors, offering is equally  necessary for healers.<br>
                <br>
  The role of the healer is a  blessing to his fellow men, but a difficulty to himself. Pain makes people  cruel and unjust, and the work of the healer also lies in closing his ears to the  words of pain and accepting with good grace what they ascribe  to him, because they are without substance. He must not compete with someone in pain, not antagonize his unjust words, when he tries to heal him,  not abandon him or when faced with his pain, withdraw in a cowardly fashion; pain  that is shared is a blessing of God. He must continue when the patient loses  his courage, must not get lured by the Sirens of temporary pity, he must be  strong and determined to heal in the name of God. <br>
  <br>
  Let him not claim the work for  himself, let him be just the instrument of the will of God, accepting the  result judged by His wisdom. No one can influence the course that has been  predetermined, therefore let him not wish it out of vanity. Let him not try to  interfere either with his spirit or with his body in the work of God. Let him guide  his light to the one who suffers, without emotionally participating and without  involving himself in it; he is called on to be absolutely logical and composed,  sober from emotional insecurities, like a surgeon at the operating table.<br>
  <br>
  The person, who asked to heal, acquired the  responsibility of his wish. The universe entrusts him with lives and there is  no room for error here. Therefore, let him feel trust in the road he follows,  wrap himself in a shield of impenetrable light, draw the circle of theurgy  around himself, and trust his guide. Nothing can threaten him if he goes along  with the Power of Good.  <br>

              Before we begin with what is  planned, it is necessary to have ensured what will activate the planes we want to attract.  In addition, let us not forget that we attract whatever resembles us, and a  positive field will approach only a corresponding  positive one. Normalization achieves harmony, whereas antithesis the cessation  of functioning. </p>
Physical fitness is absolutely necessary for  someone to be effectual. The sun, the exposure to the wind and the sea  transform the body into a solar battery, which &quot;loads&quot; energy and at the same time releases it to a large  percentage. It is wiser if someone does not expose himself to the sun, when he  has to perform a project that requires all his energy concentration on that  same day. That's because the sunlight &quot;forces&quot; the physical body to function as a mirror,  emitting as much energy as it collects from the environment, resulting in feeling  fatigue and weakness afterwards. Concentration in a shady or dark but at the  same time well ventilated place, helps the body inwardly concentrate and store  energy, in order to use it, after a short period of time obviously, directing  it towards the necessary target.<br>

              <a name="la_34"></a>&nbsp;The energy intake can be  enhanced by &quot;healing&quot; in all people, but its  transformation and further use and emission depends on the person himself.  Therefore, it is possible for us to transfer pure energy to someone, and even  to direct it to a particular centre of his, but he may immediately absorb it through  a different centre and transform it, so the &quot;healing&quot; cannot be effective as far  as its target is concerned. In this case, the responsibility of disorientation  lies with the recipient himself, and no one can intervene in this, otherwise they violate free will.<br>
              <br>
Jesus himself transferred  energy to those who were ready to receive it without trying to prevent it from  reaching its target. Jesus has intuitively seen Faith in them, meaning  letting themselves go in His hands, and that is why he addressed them with the  &quot;your faith has saved you&quot;. Faith, i.e. the confidence in the Knowledge and  Love of the Masters, the resignation from any attempt to intrude and control, enables them to send the energy that is necessary to  the appropriate point exactly, through the corresponding centre, and immediately  balance any disfunction. The restoration of the energy disfunction apparently  also restores its corresponding material manifestations later on, the time  needed though for this varies, depending on many parameters. Jesus minimized  this time, and his healings were immediately visible on the earthly level as  well. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We should urge the &quot;patients&quot;  to abandon any notion of &quot;taking part&quot; in the restoration of their energy  balance, because this may ultimately prevent the stimulation of the necessary  centre and the energy can be diffused or transmutated, unless they themselves  are capable of &quot;cooperating&quot; in the right direction.</p>
Every person can concentrate on his energy centres  and enhance them with the inflow of universal energy; let him know, though, that  the transformation of this energy, namely the functioning of the centres, is  not a matter of an order of the mind, but a result of working on corresponding  experiences.
<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a58"></a>59</strong></span><strong>. </strong>The mental trials and tribulations someone may be going through,  look like physical exercise: it benefits his overall entity, just like physical  exercise benefits his body. Modern people, who have forgotten physical fatigue,  usually suffer from excessive indolence and this has implications not  only on their material but also on their &quot;spiritual&quot; body.<br>
  <br>
The same goes for mental  exercise; it helps the soul to &quot;work out &quot;, not slacken, be in readiness, check its principles. Because  people are not in the position to know with precision and objectivity their  situation and what is necessary for them in order to improve themselves, they turn  to trainers, coaches, and ask them to put them in some exercise program. The  same applies to the spiritual field: people turn to &quot;trainers of the soul&quot;, to  Masters and Guides, to guide them in the exercise of their souls. So, the way  they show confidence in their physical trainers and do not complain because  they feel pain during the exercise, is also what they should do towards the  spiritual trainers: to trust that this &quot;program&quot; is the one required for the  improvement of their particular situation, and when they feel pain or fatigue,  not to  doubt and not to give up. Because this pain is necessary in order to train their soul  and enable it to face the demands of the circumstances.<br>
<br>
This is the significance of  faith in the Masters' Guidance. They know the particular conditions and they  also know which &quot;exercises&quot; will be more effective. Yet, how easily people  trust other people, who simply have one more knowledge credential, and they distrust the Masters  ... <br>
<br>
Physical pain, like each and every  unpleasant feeling respectively, signals a wrong psychic direction. This may be reflected in  the body too, with the appearance of a disease or remain only on a mental-emotional  level. Then the coordination with the correct vibration must return, which  usually moves evolutionally (from lower to higher levels) through the  initiative of the lower self, and its results appear in reverse order &ndash; therefore they appear in the body last. Time  decreases the more advanced the person is and can reach &quot;automatic&quot; changes in  the body, i.e. to have a &quot;miracle&quot;.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We should remember that the  body can be &quot;anaesthetized&quot; by the  disengagement of the mind from the source of the pain. It is also important for  someone to be able to differentiate himself from the suffering body, by  remembering that this is a completely temporary and partial realization of the cosmic soul, therefore no kind of  identification exists with this body. Pain is the signal the body emits in the case  of danger and is dictated by the instinct of survival. Thus, it must have these  dimensions only, and not become the centre of a person's attention. After man  accepts, realizes the signal of  his body and thanks the pain that helped him understand that somewhere &quot;damage&quot; is imminent, he ought to disperse  his attention from the specific point and proceed to his next step.</p>
Illness is often the penalty, the punishment we  ourselves impose on our self, because we fear that it does not correspond  properly to what we know. The body falls ill because the burden we impose on  it, exceeds its power. We ask too much of it with the result of &quot;burning&quot; it.  Our body knows and insists and we can decode; suffice we do not turn a deaf ear. Let us accept this as natural,  because it is not possible to proceed that quickly.<br>

              We should not forsake our self  even when it is very sick, because then it needs us the most. There are no  mistakes when the orientation is the work of God. He, who is strong, does not  fall into errors; the ones that do appear are not punished, they just attest the way. As long as life exists in the body,  mistakes are acceptable, but as we go ahead, the time needed to correct them   as well as their impact grows, in order to realize more quickly. Allow  errors  to prepare us for our advancement into Love; and let us accept this Love  silently and noiselessly, it is just as difficult as giving it ourselves. <br>
              <br>
              When we have learned to  dominate any situation, when we have such self control as to know what is  correct  and materialize it, then we will be able to heal the body as well, because  then all the natural forces will obey us.</p>
            <p>There is no aging in the Universe, but  transformation and that is how we must face the evolution of the body and not  intervene with unnatural ways of its suspension,  because in that way the only thing caused is an imbalance in the bodies and a  binding on a mental level.<br>

              Let us seek the soul's youth in creative deeds. Evolution begets  ever higher vibrations that &quot;colour&quot; the external body with eternal youth and  beauty. Keeping pace with  one's own evolutionary stage, on all levels, is a blessing: knowledge is <strong><em>the drugs, the Art of Poetry brings,</em></strong> the  understanding and faith in the Plan and the will of God is <strong><em>the essence  prepared according to the formulas of the ancient Greco-Syrian wizards.</em></strong></p>
            <p>When <strong><em>the old man contemplates </em></strong><strong><em>on the  share he still has in youth</em></strong>, he realizes  that <strong><em>youths  are moved by his own manifestation of what is beautiful </em></strong>and that <strong><em>his  visions pass before their spirited eyes.</em></strong><br>

              <a name="la_je_4"></a>Death for His people is none  other than a step that will lead them to resurrection. Death alone is not a state but a stage. For His beloved ones there is  only life, joy, light, day. They go through the opposites but they know that  these are only a minute in eternity, a dream within reality. <br>
              <br>
His beloved ones do not fear  the dark, because they know that both inside the light and inside darkness they will  find Him just the same. His beloved ones believe that inside the silence of sorrow too, He  speaks to them again, just as before. His beloved ones see His presence both  in rough as well as in calmed sea.<br>
<br>
There is no present or future  that is not determined by Him, that is why they are not afraid. Deep in their  heart that experiences the storm they keep the lantern of His presence alight.  Then pain is not reality; then pain becomes a boost which marks the beginning,  the new birth, and disappears. </p>
Whoever walks with Him walks in the eternal Light,  the unsurpassable Joy, the ceaseless Day! </div></td>
