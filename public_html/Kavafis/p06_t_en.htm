            Inertia  is always a trap of the lower self, and can often use some problems that do indeed exist as an alibi. If we do not take action in time in order to restore  the balance, if we do not move before the roads of return to life have been  lost, before we completely sink into the feeling of sorrow, solitude and the  feeling of vanity, then, one side of the self only is capable of disrupting the  complete whole:</p>

            <p>That <strong><em>each hour of his wounds; the final one slays, </em></strong>also<strong><em> concluded</em></strong> a great soul, <strong><em>Mister  Theof</em></strong><strong><em>i</em></strong><strong><em>lo</em></strong><strong><em>s Palaeologo</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong>,</strong> when <strong><em>in his despair</em>, <em>in his agony</em>,</strong> reached the point of  saying <strong>&quot;<em>I'd rather die than live</em>&quot;.</strong> No matter how much deep sorrow, <strong><em>exhaustion</em></strong> and <strong><em>weariness  from injustices and persecution</em></strong> <strong><em>his five tragic words</em></strong> may <strong><em>contain</em>,</strong> man should not let himself roll into the darkness of non-existence, expose  himself to ultimate peril. <br>
              <br>
              When we seek to escape from this life, it is as if we refuse the task we have undertaken to carry out. At that moment we identify the present with eternity, and deny Eternity in favour of the  moment.</p>
            <p>With our violent withdrawal from the earth, we immobilize ourselves in &quot;hell&quot;, meaning we entrap ourselves eternally in the thought out of  which we wished to escape; and at some point in time we shall apparently be called upon  to resurrect the life which we denied and interrupted, and to love it. The  abolition of such a choice from a previous incarnation usually entails painful  exercises. It is not a matter of a &quot;pay back&quot; or a compulsory punishment, or anything  of that kind. Simply, the only way to be led to happiness is to dissolve all   fears of all things; and that which leads man to his willing death  is the fear for life, the fear that &quot;there is no happiness any more&quot;. <br>
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>Is this peak an optical illusion? Is it an immaterial stage-design made to fool the wretched travellers?</em></strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>But it always continues. It  does not want to sit and rest so as not to waste time</em></strong><em>&hellip;</em><strong><em> To go back it neither  has the power, nor the inclination.<br>
  </em></strong><br>
  <br>
  Therefore, even at these painful  moments, when <strong><em>the soul is confused and paralyzed</em></strong> and<strong> <em>the sigh covers even the  brightest sun</em>, </strong>man ought to choose Life. And this practically means  that he puts the feeling of total futility in opposition to the initiative of  the soul for some new course, some new interest. It is not important whether he  dominates the feeling at the specific instant. Meaning    movement towards Life is also when he continues to feel despair within himself, but he  decides - <strong><em>enduring injuries and pains </em></strong>&ndash; to move in a certain direction.  Death is immobilization. Hence, the feeling  does not determine the result, but will does.  Submitting  the feeling is irrelevant to the lesson of the soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Unhappiness  is not the point of the issue, that is why we simply go through  experiences of mental anguish, which, however, are not decisive and  catastrophic. We should not, on our part, identify with the periods of crisis,  but should disengage and should know that we have just made one more step on  the way by His side. Sometimes we become reactionary because  we do not know the workings of the Laws. We suspect it through His words but we  do not know it; nor are we able to do so. <br>
<br>
The  poison is always of a dosage capable of shaking us, but powerless to turn us  around. No lesson transcends our powers, no pain can crush us if we do not  allow it to do so. Only our self can pin us down, exercises always come in  order to take us further forward. </p>
That is why man should turn away profane images,  which <strong><em>wound each hour of his,</em></strong> while there is still time, while <strong><em>in  his heart </em></strong>still<strong><em> palpitates</em> </strong>/<strong> <em>a dear hope. </em></strong>Being  occupied with earthly matters is sometimes a bitter and hard duty, yet  unavoidable. This life is not destined for rest, but for deeds; rest will come  later, when the present is certain. People of God are here in order to work, and  not live a beautiful life &ndash; something which after all belongs to another Time-Space. That  is why they do not seek the route of &quot;bliss&quot; and certainty in their earthly  present. Nobody ever <strong><em>knew happiness</em> </strong>/<strong> <em>pure</em>, <em>and long life, and  wealth, and wisdom </em></strong>/<strong><em> without base  sweat, or servile work. </em></strong>
<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a20"></a>20</strong></span><strong>.<em> Demaratus</em>,</strong> just like <strong><em>Mister Theofilus Palaeologus</em></strong><em>,</em> both knew the cause of their pain. But  there are people, like <strong><em>Anna Comnena</em>,</strong> who are not ready to  dig up the layers of their subconscious yet, in order to seek the truth behind  the pain. Therefore, they travel disoriented, as they are afraid to face the side  of their self, which emerges. <strong><em>How the pages of her history pulsate with  emotion and agitation, in which she laments for her widowhood, that haughty  Greek</em></strong><strong><em> woman</em>,</strong> in  reality, though, she laments <strong><em>that she did not manage to acquire the  Kingship &hellip;</em></strong><br>
  <br>
For someone to suffer in his life  is selfish. It means that he still moves only around his self, repaying old debts.  And he will not be able to come out of his fortress if he does not realize everything  that  conceals it; he will continue to walk in the insecurity he himself  cultivates, without, however, realizing it. <br>
<br>
It is, therefore, necessary to look  at his fear face to face, without evasion and distortion. It is not bad to  admit our fear, even though we may think that logically it is foolish, on the contrary, putting boundaries around it with specific  parameters, will help us  face it in its precise dimensions. Because we are our own doctors, we must make  the most accurate diagnosis before we move on to a therapeutic treatment. And  of course being ashamed of our illness does not help its cure at all.<br>

              It is finally so clear that as soon as someone recognizes and comprehends within himself the true causes, which created the  pain, when he <strong><em>confesses</em></strong> <strong><em>the truth</em></strong> to himself<strong>,</strong>  the conditions which had created the external sheath of the  facts are abolished of their own accord.<br>
              <br>
As long as our body is material,  pain will accompany knowledge. People's thought interprets pain negatively. The other dimension, however, gives pain the texture of a gift.<br>
<br>
God has appointed that we give  birth to our children in pain, and that has a symbolic meaning. Woman-Eve is  the soul of man, his creative ability and breath, the spirit that  distinguishes him from other stages of creation  which do not have the ability to create. And this birth must be given with  mental anguish, with labour and spiritual pain.<br>
<br>
Man must go through the turmoil and  hardship which we all know, in order to culminate in the discovery of wisdom, not an initial discovery, because he already knows, but a discovery through the paths  of the oblivion of consciousness. This is the only way God has appointed for  his people to return to paradise.<br>
<br>
The most difficult thing for man is to manage not to confuse the Truth with the conditions of the trial, so as not to stumble into errors and come up with unfair disappointments. The generalization  of the partial and the transitory can lead to greatly going astray, because it  gives weight to a conclusion that is not based on catholicity. For man to learn to distinguish the transitory from  the permanent, the secondary from the primary is an internal virtue which is  ensured by sober judgment, patience, right thinking. For someone to attribute  &quot;Give to Caesar what is Caesar's&quot;, it is necessary for his evolution on the way of Cosmic Harmony.</p>
            <p>There are many ways for us to be happy, as long as we ourselves do not lay boundaries and limitations.  If we name happiness as a small symbol, then it is difficult to find it. But if  we broaden the boundaries of the whole, then we find the capability of being  happy, every moment and under any circumstances. As we said, pain has only  occasional on the spot usefulness, in order to prompt us to action. Other than  that, we should abolish it.<br>

              </tr>
      </table>
            <p><strong></strong><br>
              The  struggle that presents great difficulties is the one that names the champion. The boundaries are nowhere predetermined and toil always corresponds  to the trophy. <br>
              <br>
Steps in the night are invisible; but just after dawn, the whole road that has been traveled is revealed. In life the sun rises when the voice of inertia silences, when the soul bravely decides to confront the fighters of Darkness.  And the battle is not over, before the cycle returns to its start. Fleeing  from the battle is not the practice of the<em> <strong>virtuous workers,</strong></em> of the true Warriors of  God's Love. And the result has not been judged, before the dust has settled. Whoever is found there, goes on without being disappointed or  involved with premature and inappropriate conclusions. Besides,  conclusions belong to History &ndash; while he belongs to Life.<br>
<br>
He, who is walking up <strong><em>the mountain</em></strong><em>,</em> cannot view it from above.<br>
<br>
Paradise is here, in the present, in every moment. Difficulties  let us say, are from the outside. We from within should react having joy as  a target. Let us use pain as an indication of a forthcoming lesson and let us  become critical of that which comes to us. If we deem that we want something,  we keep it. Otherwise, we let it go. At some point, this will happen  automatically but, finally, we can always choose happiness.</p>
            <p>People, who rejoice with hidden selfishness when  they are tormented, are far from the meaning of this Life, which is eternal.  The leveling of the self means idleness of creation and deadening, and under  the veneer of the elimination  of selfishness,  dark forces interfere with our task. The most important thing is that these people cannot receive help, no  matter how persistently they may ask for it, because their plea is not true, but a disguised intention of theft.

              Pain,  when  not dealt with in its true dimensions, i.e. as a means of  training the soul, becomes a drug for the people who do not have the courage to  desire and seek Creation.<br>
              <br>
              The storm waters the soil for grass  to sprout even greener and brighter in the sun. Nothing remains the same, and  evil is just a change of phase, a stop off point in the eternal bright way. God is  always near us in power and in weakness, in victory and in defeat, in light and  in darkness.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a21"></a>21</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Incarnated man who has  returned to earth in order to complete himself wears the cloak of weakness,  fear and vulnerable character. That is why he stumbles into errors and is  devastated by great temptation. In his effort to <strong><em>negate</em></strong> <strong><em>every  chillsome influence</em>,</strong> and his fervent desire to find that spiritual  matter - the immaterial forms of energy - with which he will feed his ethereal  bodies, <strong><em>his foot will slip</em></strong> <strong><em>on thorns </em></strong>many times. But he must  reveal the serpent, bite the apple, because that is the way earthly thisness  commands, and forgive himself by working in the way of Good. The earthly world  is a plane of battle.<br>

            <p><em>&hellip;</em><strong><em> Many daily climb the rugged mountain on which so many Loves slow down  and tire and faint and perish.

            <p><strong><em>&nbsp;The way at  the beginning of the ascent is very smooth, and they are deceived and go ahead  half way. But here little by little it becomes rough.

              </em></strong>            </p>
            <p>It  is then that <strong><em>in the House of the Soul the Passions run undisturbed</em></strong><em>:</em> fears  which have been covered up for a long time, <strong><em>desires</em></strong> which <strong><em>were </em></strong><strong><em>dressed </em></strong><strong><em>in mourning within himself</em></strong><strong>,</strong> strong internal forces, materials  of explosive power. These <strong><em>big sharp stones</em></strong> constitute the opposite  material force in our spiritual inclination and produce a negative result in  our life.</p>

              People  who work on the surface, because they are afraid to reach the bottom, and  create alibis, that they supposedly work as much as they should, easily criticize   he who lives <strong><em>in a cheerful feast</em>,</strong> where <strong><em>he gets drunk, forgets and adorns himself,  and rejoices, </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> and despises the tyrant sun</em></strong>; he who does not manage to keep his promise and <strong><em>to the same fatal joy, lost, he  goes again</em></strong>. Here, however, criticism has no place, but praise does;  praise to those who bend in front of the truth; because the flexibility of the soul  is a sign of commencement. The person, who <strong><em>swears to start a better life</em>,</strong> has just started to unfold a thread of spiritual life; because even though <strong><em>the  Passions </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> rule all the chambers </em></strong>of  his soul, / <strong><em>from the door of his house to its innermost depths</em></strong><em>,</em> the memory of the target of his liberation from Matter emerges within himself at the same time. This person has accepted to start  a painful course that will lead him to self-knowledge. He has realized that he  has to curb the passions which prevent knowledge from coming to light.<br>
              <br>
              As  our <a href="../afos/Aivanhov/index_en.htm" class="la">Master O.M. Aivanhov</a>  says, our passions neither get uprooted nor effaced:  as on the physical plane we inject a vaccine into our body, a small,  infinitesimal dose of a germ, necessary to strengthen  us, likewise in the  spiritual plane, Good draws from these powerful sources which we carry within ourselves and transforms them for its own strengthening. Our Self draws from  primitive, unrefined energies &ndash; &quot;washes away our sins&quot;, like Jesus symbolically  did with the &quot;sinners&quot; &ndash; and transforms them into love, light and spirituality.  That is why He advises not to uproot the weeds, because we shall uproot the  wheat together with them but, on the contrary, wait until harvesting in order  to separate them.</p>
            <p>The need to make a decision denotes exactly the opposite, that the decision is not obvious.&nbsp;<br>

              Passion reminds us that there is a &quot;self&quot; we are afraid of and want to avoid.  We should not therefore compete with our own self, but on the contrary we must  let it enter the side we feel intolerable and naturally do not want to allow to  show itself. So long as we do not allow it to do so, situations will appear,  which will remind us that it is there. The universe will be giving &quot;opportunities&quot;, will be creating the appropriate circumstances in  order to work exactly on that and help us find Life and our Self.<br>
              <br>
              It is also ours, like a wounded or scarred limb, and we must accept it and love it, include it in the unity of our  self. So, let us work non-dependence consciously and with alertness. Let us be  prepared for the specific side and let it live. Whenever the old feeling  appears, let us not fight it to make it disappear, but let us accept it with  love. Let us bring our self into the position which we fight to abolish, and  let us experience it with courage. We shall begin to see that nothing is as threatening  as we name it or determine it to be.<br>

              Let us use all the means we have at our disposal (readings of Masters, books, thinking, friends) in order to face  these crises mechanistically, until knowledge is instilled within us and we  adopt it completely. This needs time and sufficient repetitions, therefore we  should not deny the trials that will free us even sooner, but on the  contrary we should welcome every repetition that leads us to success. We should  not ask our self to cope without help, because that means on the one hand  self-underestimation and on the other selfishness.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a22"></a>22</strong></span><strong>. </strong>If the present torments  us let us remember that it carries an extra heavy past on its back; we should  think that it is a burden of centuries and that we already manage quite well:  and this is the beginning towards the direction of the liberation from its  threat.<br>

              Nothing stops when its cycle of  existence has not been completed. So, let us not hurry to shake off a situation or,   the opposite, let us not be afraid that we will not have time to bring it to  completion, because when the necessity is over &ndash; when we have internally  completed the course of the soul that is necessary &ndash; the way vanishes by  itself.<br>
              <br>
              We should not stop when night  encircles us; it is only one night and morning will dawn in a while. Night also helps us learn to trust our feet while our eyes cannot check the way. Night also  helps us learn that we must not move all the time, because in life we do not constantly have the same rhythm. And moreover that we must not trust only what we see,  because the eyes see as much as the light allows them to. Let us remember,  therefore, that we see what the Light permits us to see, but we must also  trust what the Night temporarily hides from our eyes.<br>
              <br>
              Evil does not exist anywhere in  reality. Fear creates hallucinations which nestle agreeably in the Night, and  people are misled into connecting hallucinations and ghosts with the Night. The  truth, though, is that whatever is not visible exists exactly where it  was, when it was visible; because the invisible is present and real for all  those who know the places. <br>
            </p>
<p><strong><em>I do not know whether perversion  gives power. Sometimes I think so. But for sure it is the source of greatness.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br> 
  </em></strong>The grand masterpiece starts from foundations hidden inside the earth, great height is owed to vast depth, so that is where we must look for the beginning of our task. He who digs deeply within himself and reorganizes the subsoil of his soul in such a way, so as to endure shouldering the height of creation in the future, will produce a sublime piece  of work. Every superb sculpture starts from the selection of the stone.<br>
  <br>
He,  who loves Life, welcomes all its sides. Throws the good seed wherever he can,  but also trusts the rain that will fertilize it. Each time he hurts, he quickly  disconnects from self-rejection and guilt and does not identify with the  now, which simply constitutes a link in an enormous chain.<br>
<br>
Only  then should he control his steps, when he feels that his development has  stopped. Then it means that he has to allow his heart to speak to him about the  course of Life. While he is walking on it he should not be concerned about anything but that, and not with untimely and superficial evaluations.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong><em><br>
  (&hellip;) it is as if we were  asking from a man who has lived a long life, full of action and intensely productive,  to have stayed away from every adventure, to never have gone on a binge, never  have been mixed up in the most unlikely, the most foreign elements to him. Perhaps even this getting involved of his might have contributed to his vitality.</em></strong><br>
</p>
<p><br>
  We should not judge people  according to their behaviour, because this is something deceptive. A behaviour  may be incited by conscious or subconscious reasons, but the main thing is that  what we receive is not what really exists. Each time,  incarnated man  is essentially only one realization of certain elements of his Self, sometimes   he also even bears elements which do not belong to Him permanently, on grounds of  expediency.<br>
  <br>
  This man stops being <strong><em>pleased  with ignorance &ndash; golden silence</em>,</strong> which he imposes on his subconscious  out of fear for <strong><em>the destructive action</em>,</strong> but gives the fight with his material  existence.<br>
