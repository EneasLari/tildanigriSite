            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a42"></a>43</strong></span><strong>. </strong>People who go in for demanding  athletic activities are exposed to quite a few injuries, so much so that  sometimes it is an oxymoron: they choose physical exercise, which offers  health, but because of the constant bruises they seem to be in worse &quot;health&quot; than  the rest of the people. However, it is not so. Because a distinction must be  made between injury and illness. Injury is an unavoidable contusion, due to the engagement in difficult activities, which derives from the environment,  while illness derives from within man and for this reason it successively  influences all his bodies, from the most ethereal to the material one. So he, who bears injuries, can be in full health, contrary to someone who,  because of stagnation, does not exercise and seems intact and &quot;healthy&quot;.<br>
              <br>
This example is worth keeping in  order to better comprehend certain states of the soul. The man who loves the activity  of the soul and develops it, most of the time feels hurt, precisely because of  the injuries he undergoes during his confrontation with the external  environment, but, overall, he is the healthier one, and not whoever avoids  exposing themselves to conjunctures with a high degree of &quot;dangerousness&quot; as regards  their emotional world.<br>
<br>
Naturally, this is not valid on all  occasions, since there are people who live a quiet and safe life, because this  is what they must do, meaning that is their life plan. They do not avoid  anything, but nor do they go after anything; but they have been called for this,  consequently they keep pace correctly with their Self.</p>
            <p>The important thing is for all those who are often  struck by injuries, to know that their life's work leads them to high peaks  and  they necessarily walk along rough roads.<br>

              <a name="la_ga_3"></a>So, whoever <strong><em>climbs the rugged mountain</em></strong>,  will live through the supreme human experience, the one of <strong><em>barren love</em></strong>: he does not  need a love that would offer him something since he has already experienced that.  He needs a love in which he will be asked to give, without  response.  This love will lead him to recognize the boundaries of fear at some point, to  demolish it  once and for all, to overcome the barrier it puts to experiencing  the grand Man-God. The thought behind the thought, the primary force that moves  the thread of life, is our desire to experience the authenticity of    our entire divine Self and not the desire to rest. Because resting means to deny  the endless and attach to the partial.            </p>

              Whoever  truly loves, knows that no wound bleeds forever. Besides, he pays attention only to the wounds of his beloved  ones. Because, only then  are you convinced of Love; not when you are receiving it but when you are  giving it. And he, who can give love, is worthy of it, and he knows it and  still has it even if they deny it to him; while he who denies it to others,  will never encounter it. <br>
              <br>
Love is a feeling of wholeness and  safety. Whoever loves cannot feel empty, even when he is externally alone,  because love is an inner activity, a unity with the entire Universe &ndash; and not  isolation.<br>
<br>
Whoever loves, gives precedence to his interest  for the other  and not for his self. Love is not weakness; it is power,  bravery, inner activation. It is not possible for love to leave us inert and  disorientated. We always know what to do, when love is illuminating our way,  because this action has crucial features: it does not exhaust us psychologically, i.e. it leaves us more complete than before as regards to the power of our  soul, it is not directed toward our self, it does not take into consideration  comparisons or levels of reciprocation.<br>
<br>
It is very important to confirm our  emotional domination, and this is succeeded  through hard trial and exercise. Only a noble love  can give fruits prolifically, otherwise the seed of the fruit will be carrying  the imperfect.<br>

            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">
              <tr>
                <td><p><strong><em>From now on  everything is over. My life has gone black.</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>This world will  have no joy for me, ever again.</em></strong></p></td>

              Disappointment from the &quot;failure&quot;  of a love affair comes because we connect the things happening within ourselves with  the causes for their appearance which are found externally. Individuals act as  chemical catalysts, but they must not be charged with the responsibility for the  reactions. Everything that happens to us concerns us exclusively and uniquely  &ndash; and would not have happened if we were different. <br>
              <br>
For as long as the Truth shines, we will  discover the greatness of the Word within us, we shall be flooded with the  trust which belongs to those who live with the Truth, being ready to bring any  person down and endure every loss.<br>
<br>
It is a victory, this last trial  of the <strong><em>barren love</em></strong>, victory and prevalence of power; victory of  individuality, when the idealized people next to us are brought down, victory  of life. Let us not be afraid then, because it is not possible to lose  something we ourselves  <em>are</em>. We do not have love, we are love,   even if all that we see next to us disappears, even if the world we step on  tumbles. No form stops the Light, no space imprisons  the Eternal. </p>
Because man's real need is his reunion in the  divine Body, the return to Unity, and this is fulfilled through real love. Our own love  fulfils us because it brings us closer to our old, divine self, to our true  divine thisness. Besides, when the offering of love is pure, without the involvement  of selfishness, then not only do we not expect the result it will have on the  other, but we wish, out of humbleness, to remain in the shadows.
<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a43"></a>44</strong></span><strong>. </strong>The more spiritual life deepens the  less man identifies with the specific body his soul has worn in its present  incarnation. He realises that the body is something he has borrowed from the  lower material levels for a certain period of time, and this obviously neither belongs  to him, nor is eternally his.<br>
  <br>
At some moment of his evolutionary  course man is destined to transform the energy he receives from the universe &ndash;  through the vehicle of sexuality &ndash; by higher centres. He will then start using  it for the production of his spiritual and creative work, spiritualizing at the  same time his own self to an ever increasing degree.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><em>My life goes through  fluctuations of desire, through conceptions &ndash; sometimes fulfilled &ndash; erotic  ones.</em></strong><br>
  <strong><em><br>
  My work tends towards  thinking. Maybe rightly so.</em></strong><br>
  <strong><em><br>
  Expressing myself more widely,  perhaps an artistic plane would not be sufficient for me to remain. Perhaps, its  nature, does not allow it to be enough for me. </em></strong></p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  Sexual energy, as we have already said, is the only  means that can lead man to Unity. It constitutes the bond between Matter and  Spirit. Just as it helps man to be &quot;born&quot; 
  in the material world, meaning to pass  from the spiritual existence inside a material body, in the same way it helps  him be &quot;reborn&quot; in the spiritual world, return fully conscious to his divine  nature.<br>

              Besides, spirituality is the other aspect  of sexuality; it is the same energy, differently transformed: <strong><em>expressing  himself more widely</em></strong>, <strong><em>the nature</em></strong> of man's erotic life<strong><em> does  not permit it to be sufficient</em></strong> for him. Exhausted by <strong><em>heavenly  intoxication</em> <em>from the serving of  pleasure</em>, <em>finally when he falls down  on the way</em>, <em>then his luck is enviable</em></strong>;  because then he will start experiencing his spiritual nature.<br>

              <strong><em>I work like the ancients </em></strong><em>(Greeks).<strong> They wrote history, they created philosophy,  &hellip; lovesick &ndash; so many of them &ndash; the same as me.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong><br>
            </strong></em><br>
            The enlightened man does not seek to leave the world  that raised him and does not underestimate the lessons it is giving him, or its  value. Earthly thisness is sacred, since Our Lord Jesus Christ was  clothed in it as well. He attributes to it the holiness it deserves, and honours  it by seeking to experience all its facets. Those who renounce it, do so only  when the deed they have been entrusted with by God, demands so.
            </p>
            <p>Some people, like <strong><em>Simon </em></strong>for instance who<strong><em> climbed up the pillar </em></strong>or <a href="../afos/Gavrilia/index_en.htm" class="la">Mother Gavrilia</a>, come with a certain specified  mission. For them neither  choices nor  crossroads exist because their course is well defined. They only follow in the  steps that are being dictated to them. Besides, no one becomes an ascetic in  order to find God <strong><em>and his empty life crying within him, </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> and his desires  wearing their mourning black</em></strong>, but  on the contrary, because he has met Him, because  honest love, the outspoken  one, the revealing one has spoken in his heart. </p>
            <p>This  stage of the soul's life cannot become understood by earthly people, as it does  not belong to their dimension. They, completely absorbed in endless discussions  about the value of <strong><em>Lamon</em></strong>, a poet who filled Beirut with enthusiasm, felt the <strong><em>momentary  shiver</em></strong> by their <strong><em>accidental magnetic </em></strong><strong><em>neighbourliness</em></strong> with the spiritual world, when their mind flew to <strong><em>Simon</em></strong>, in order to return  afterwards,  with the same zeal, for criticism, evaluation,  classification <strong><em>&quot;Syria's first poet&quot;</em></strong>, second, etc.<br>

              God has placed the stones exactly  where they must be. No stone resembles the other. No path of life is the same  for two people. Each one has a distinct  life task and must find it and take  care of it.</p>

                  <br>
              Just like life is an inheritance  and you've done nothing to earn it as a reward, in the same way Pleasure must  be an inheritance.

              It is known that the activation of  the centres in man's spiritual body cannot be achieved with intellectual  effort, but only by going through the experiences which can stimulate each  centre. And in this case the activation is a task &quot;outside man&quot; (the incarnated  one). The aim is  full awareness and not  avoidance. Even the  experience of instincts and &quot;low&quot; emotional states is necessary, no step is  less necessary in the path of the Son of Man. <br>
              <br>
              The evaluation of people, by  extension, according to an enhanced functioning of one or several centres  is, on the one hand out of place, since nobody can safely distinguish such a  thing neither for his fellow-man &ndash; nor even perhaps, for his own self&ndash; and on  the other hand it is unethical, because it serves reasons for personal development  or for the undertaking  of a specific mission, therefore it is absolutely  necessary to be just so.<br>

              The great leaning towards the  spiritual world creates an imbalance in the development of man's several  bodies. Our withdrawal from physical life can create an overgrown Astral body  and disorientate the overall sensitive nature of the soul. We must  counterbalance the earthly dimension with the spiritual one, this is absolutely  accomplishable. We must be able to work with logic and the senses equally,  while at the same time we manifest our spiritual nature; to conquer the <strong><em>perilous</em></strong> balance of <strong><em>Myrtias</em></strong>:

              No man is capable of coping with  the expectations that &quot;great love&quot;, the memory of the divine Erotic Love creates  within us, because that is destined only for the Eternal and the Insuperable,  for God Himself. People who project this emotion onto simple people, connect them  with it &ndash; and their self -, and try to experience it believing that the other  person &quot;provoked&quot; it in them, are condemned to be disappointed and become embittered,  because they tried to &quot;close the Spirit in a bottle&quot; &hellip; Love must not be  connected with individuals, just as the form must not be connected with the  immaterial spirit. Love is not subjected to limitations and conditions. If  there is someone who helped us in a specific conjunction of circumstances to  recall it from the space of the Eternal and the Infinite, after that we should  not identify him with It, because it is as if we identify the moment with time.<br>
              <br>
This is also what the first of the  ten Commandments mentions, when it exhorts not to love another as much as the  Lord and our God, and not to connect any other earthly person with Love which  only in the boundaries of Him can we render. This is what Jesus means when he  says that &quot;no one can serve two masters&quot; &ndash; matter and the spirit. This is the  meaning of Platonic Love, the love of the soul for God, which no earthly erotic  love is capable of substituting. This is the &quot;secret marriage&quot;, as the mystics  have called it, the marriage that takes place within ourselves, when we unite the  conscious (earthly) part of our self with the unconscious (higher, divine) &ndash;  the manifested with the non-manifested &ndash; and we restore ourselves to a complete  Whole. <br>

Eros is the safety valve for the attainment  of the Work of God. Eros is the power that holds man together with the object &ndash; whether  the latter is a person or a situation &ndash; and as such, it internally ensures the  continuous presence of the &quot;worker&quot; in the place he should be. Just like the  mother, who through the unappeased eros towards the newly-born child, remains  attached to it, ensuring its survival, also in this way man feels eros for  anything that must continue to be in his life for a certain purpose. Eros is the  binding power of the Universe. And, hence, &quot;contrary&quot; to love, because love  does not bind to a compulsory unity, but it liberates. When the deed is  achieved, when the purpose is completed, then eros is transmuted into love,  because the compulsory factor that created the dependence, ceases to exist: when  the infant grows older, then the need for the mother ceases, hence the tenacious  bond loosens  and the binding eros is transformed into liberating love.<br>
<br>
Relatively speaking, actual eros, the  eros of man towards God, is transformed into liberating love; when man manages to free himself  from the dependence of the <em>need</em> of  God, then he will have found Him once and for all. Whoever believes in himself  does not &quot;need&quot; God, because only then does God cohabit  in his house.<br>

This man advances on the path of   Bliss without qualms and fears. He becomes a worthy co-worker in the divine  Deed, he becomes the bridge that carries the bliss of the ethereal life to the  earthly one. <strong><em>He sows the light as if he were a  gardener</em></strong>, the seed of love and truth into people's souls, he plants in  their hearts <strong><em>flowers of the exquisite gardens of another place</em>, </strong><em>/</em><strong> <em>where Theories</em>, <em>and Rhythms</em>, <em>and Insights dwell</em>. </strong></p>

              They honour their less enlightened  fellow men, because in that way they honour their Creator and His deed. When the  sophist Medon meets the <strong><em>barren and unfavourable love</em></strong>, on the  face of a heartless king, Ptolemeus Filopator, he ought not to <strong><em>deplore</em></strong> him, but on the contrary honour him, and that is what the Poet is calling him to  do.<br>

              <a name="la_es"></a>Jesus once came  into this  life and tried to show the Way of Truth to the people. We can understand the  anguish of the realization, the anguish of His Soul, when these people, for  whom he had accepted to be &quot;imprisoned&quot; in the chains of Matter &ndash; and what's more knowing the inevitable &ndash; <strong><em>foreseeing that Ephialtes will appear in the  end, </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> and that the Medes will eventually break through </em></strong>&ndash; they were  unfaithful to His words or did not manage to hear them at all. However, he  struggled to plant the seed in the barren soil as well as in the more fertile,  He accepted Fate without complaint, hiding the unbearable pain of Solitude  inside His Love for all those who were not following Him. And He continued to  show them the Way, outdoing His Self who asked for Redemption. He continued  talking to them, forgetting the grief of Uniqueness. And He forgave them, <strong><em>even  when everything appeared as if the sacrifice was made in vain</em></strong>, while he  was suffering the most cruel pain, the pain provoked by the strike of the  beneficiary to the benefactor. But his Word was saying that &quot;Love is long  suffering, does not ask for itself&quot;, no matter how much  it may be suffering through the  ignorance of the others.<br>
