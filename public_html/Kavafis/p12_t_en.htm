              The course in life is a course of  convergence and unity, and precisely for this reason sexual intercourse is so  important in each person's life, because it reminds him of the most essential  reason for his existence.              <br>

              The <strong><em>small room</em></strong>, our life, <strong><em>shines  alight</em></strong> and is illuminated by the <strong><em>heat of the sensual rapture</em></strong>: during  sexual intercourse, the spinal column &ndash; the vessel for energy &ndash; glows from a  &quot;liquid fire&quot; which starts to flow like a rapid torrent. The current of life  runs through man's axis and radiates the light. Seven great energy power centres  along the spinal column are lit like live torches in the night. The bodies of  the beloved are wrapped around a burning, watery whirlwind by-passing the  natural forces, conquering gravity.<br>
              <br>
              The mates experience the feeling of  abandonment since their conscience knows that they will be led, even if only for  a short while, to the celestial frequency. They let their erotic ardour become  the life-giving current that will lead them back to the Light, to the world  that gave birth to them and where they will be found again.<br>

              they, who <strong><em>gave themselves, blissful, to  love</em></strong>, unite their bodies because deep down they long to unite their  souls. They struggle to merge their bodies, as if they want to crush them, as  if they are standing as a barrier to the uniting of their souls, which try to  quench their unappeased desire for unity. The earthly shell they have to penetrate  is hard and resistant. The beloved ones, however, even though for  a moment only,  manage to float weightless into the light. They travel beyond the senses,  where, neither time nor space exist, nor thinking but only heart, which listens  to the vibration of Love. <br>
              <br>
              The burning streams of light  release themselves and freely flow and reunite with their Source. For a while,  the poles are united. Duality, which divides the Self and splits the existence,  has been defeated.<br>
              <br>
              One absorbs the other into his  energy; they become one Form, one Soul, into the one impenetrable Light that  shines from their merging. They unite with the Soul of the World, they experience  the unity of the Self in their consciousness, they experience the very  definition of Love: they feel they belong to each other, because they are one  inside the Self.<br>
              <br>
              As the one initiates the  other in the Temple of his Soul and lets him penetrate into the holy of his Holies,  the beloved ones, the ones who <strong><em>drank of strong wines, as </em></strong><em>/<strong> the  brave in sensual pleasure drink</strong></em>, they reveal their true nature and  together touch the End, the Everything, granting immortality to each other.<br>
              <br>
              This <strong><em>by</em></strong> <strong><em>no means ordinary light that emanates</em></strong>,  is produced by sexual energy, in which the mystics have taught, lies the secret  of life, the elixir of immortality. The production of light from the joining of  the two poles, the energy that is released from their uniting is so powerful  that it can transform the spirit into matter. Its power is such that it can  make the soul give birth to all it desires: a physical or a spiritual creation.  Sexual energy is the sole driving force on Earth, which can transform the  immaterial into material, launch a soul from the ethereal planes and give birth  to a child.<br>

              In this vibration of ecstasy, love  and joy, <strong><em>into the illuminated night</em></strong>, the mates linger as long as they  can. When they feel that they have lost this feeling of their connection with  the divine frequency, they desire to repeat the process of their unification in  order to taste again <strong><em>the sensual rapture of this heat</em>. </strong><br>

Desire is primarily the boost to  evolution. Desire on all levels is one of the primary instincts, with which man  has been co-kneaded, so that his evolutionary course is ensured.<br>
<br>
Being an instinct, desire is  uncontrollable. Man ought to classify and evaluate his desires before he lets  himself be led by them.<br>
<br>
The lower self, which is not &quot;lower&quot;  but less powerful, must not be repressed because it is the one that constitutes the material  realization of the divine element, and only through it, is it possible for the  Spirit to descend and for the Definite Union to be achieved. Desires,  therefore, which the lower self gives birth to, ought to be received carefully,  and under no circumstances should man put as his target the total eradication  of this instinct &ndash; something which often happens and indeed in the name of  &quot;high&quot; and &quot;holy&quot; intentions.<br>

              Before man gets to intervening in  his functions in a regulatory manner, he should dedicate time to studying them,  so as to understand how the whole Creation is made down to its smallest detail in an  excellent, complete and indispensable way.<br>
              <br>
              The struggle of the enlightened man  must be directed not to uprooting every trace of the birth of desire from  within himself &ndash; something that he will not achieve easily in any case, because  Nature has almighty mechanisms of survival &ndash; but to choosing those desires  which, through the Principles and the Laws, can lead him to higher levels.<br>
              <br>
              The desires that are born have  various causes, endogenous (of this or of previous lives), or exogenous  (influences from others). In all cases man must carefully examine their origin,  and  to where they are leading him .<br>
              <br>
              As soon as man acquires consciousness  of his course, he has the tendency to want to disavow every desire, fearing  that this is not possible to conform to the Principles. Renouncement from   desires means the deadening of a part of Nature, and we must all become consciously aware  that only through Nature can all-consciousness in God be achieved.<br>
              <br>
              The descent of Jesus' Spirit down  to the earthly world, came to show precisely how important earthly existence is  &ndash; which some &quot;enlightened&quot; ones under the orders of a certain &quot;religion&quot; so easily  and without thinking, but perhaps also with pride, disapprove of. <br>
              <br>

              We must never restrain  energy  but we must be careful to channel it correctly. Love, which unites two people  in sexual intercourse, functions as a safety valve so as to turn sexual energy towards  a receiver in a smooth way. We people study for years at the University to  learn to properly connect electric cables, in order to avoid devastating  short-circuits, but we do not think long before we &quot;connect cables of sexual  energy&quot; &hellip; And certainly, we do not choose to stay in the dark, out of fear of  short-circuits, we simply study and know beforehand where and how we will  connect.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a40"></a>41</strong></span><strong>. </strong>In an erotic relationship every person shows his archetypal imprint, where it  appears without control, without modifications and interventions, without it  being able to conceal or &quot;prettify&quot; itself. And the other person who  participates in this relationship sees and decodes this precise imprint &ndash; <strong><em>the emanation  of love</em></strong> &ndash; which he has inscribed in his  subconscious before he was incarnated and this makes him seek the corresponding  person. So, external beauty or any other quality is not the one that  attracts people in a sexual relationship, but their energy identity.<br>

          </table>
            <p><strong></strong><br>
              Therefore, if we worry about  how we may &quot;seem&quot; to someone, we should think that what he &quot;sees&quot; is our energy  emission, the imprint of our energy, and not the body or any other special  characteristic.<br>
            </p>
            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">

                <td><p><strong><em>in there he glimpsed a face, he glimpsed a countenance,</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>that urged him on and he entered (&hellip;)</em></strong></p></td>

              If we return to some old example,  we see that every &quot;role&quot; requires a certain physical type, and when man is  incarnated he materializes exactly this form which will help his specific  mission, and will make him recognizable to exactly those he should be.<br>
              <br>
Let not the limitations of the  current body be decisive for our actions. Let us visualize the &quot;new&quot; body, the  one which will let our true Superior form - <strong><em>the eidolon-image of our new body</em></strong> &ndash; reveal almost completely, as God has given it to us, unique for each one.  This imprint already exists inscribed very deeply in the eyes of each human  being and in the aura, which, however, is not yet widely visible and recognizable.<br>
            </p>
            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">

              </tr>
          </table>
            <p><strong></strong><br>
              This identity of the Soul does not  alter during the successive incarnations, that is why a person is finally  recognizable and unique, no matter how much the Law of Karma has charged his  thick matter with elements and characteristics necessary for his course each  time. Suffice to say we remember in our dreams, the way we &quot;recognize&quot; that it  is that specific person, even when his external characteristics are completely  vague and hard to discern, or even different from those with which we have  connected him in the current life.<br>
              <br>
The more we love and accept our  body, the more we act more positively and correctly towards it and in that way  we free ourselves from previous karma, while at the same time we carefully  prepare the coming incarnations.<br>

              Man is incarnated without all that  he has acquired, becoming evident on an earthly level. His earthly cloak is often very  different from the immaterial one, and includes these elements which will  facilitate the intake of the predestined experiences he has come to take. This  happens as far as his first assumed image is concerned.<br>
              <br>
As we know, even the &quot;densest&quot;  matter is in reality an empty space in the larger proportion &ndash; if someone  contemplates the distance of the void space which is between the nucleus and the  electrons in an atom of matter. Consequently, this image of matter that our  eyes receive, and which is that particular one,  because our eyes receive the transmissions of the specific part of the  spectrum, is variable. We can understand this, when we contemplate how many  times we wonder at seeing someone else admiring some person whom we &quot;see&quot; as  ugly.<br>
<br>
This happens because the  transmission of the image of the particular structure, which is a man,  interacts with various planes, of other people or spaces. A man, when found next  to a plane which is positive for him, appears to &quot;glow&quot; &ndash; and vice versa.<br>
<br>
Often, what we see regarding ourselves does  not coincide with what we transmit and  another  person sees. This has to do with our own internal state at a particular time, and  the corresponding one of the other person in the other case.<br>
<br>
Man's nature moves on the axis of bipolarity,  therefore his Gender is manifested in a dual way as well. The &quot;genders&quot; are  two, but this is in force only on the level of the lower material body. Man's  higher bodies bear the two energy qualities within themselves &ndash; male and female &ndash;  which interchange constantly, moving to all regions of the spectrum of Gender.  In reality, the Gender is One, with infinite manifestations.<br>
<br>
Man, the incarnated one, is subjected  to the law of multi-fission and of the partial. Hence, he can manifest or  experience only one state of being each time. That is to say, one cannot be &ndash;  as far as his external, material side is concerned &ndash; a man and a woman at the  same time, or tall and short at the same time, or feel  both hot and cold, neither can he see himself spherically, etc.<br>
<br>
No person is utterly &quot;male&quot; or  utterly &quot;female&quot;, absolutely active or absolutely passive, absolutely warm or  absolutely cold, neither can there ever exist a clear and distinct division  between the two energy qualities. Every man is a unique mixture of the two  qualities, as he has been composed of these female and male powers in a  different proportion each time. <strong><em>We are a mixture here</em>. </strong>We all are<strong> <em>in part  pagans and in part with Christian leanings</em></strong>: our incarnation imposes the  manifestation of part or parts of the Human Whole.</p>
So, every person manifests one unique manifestation  of Gender. The manifestations of Gender are infinite like the hues of colours,  the frequencies of sounds, or numbers. Just like white is not the absence of  colour but the synthesis of all colours, so the soul is not genderless, as it  is sometimes wrongly considered, but bears  both genders  together in a synthesis. When we combine all the colours, we reach white, likewise when we combine  the two genders within ourselves (and all their intermediate manifestations), we shall  have condensed the opposites at the same point, the a-sexual. In the spiritual  world there are no genders, because there is no division or partial  manifestation of the One and the Whole.
<p><strong><em><br>
  And my sexual life has its  manifestation &ndash; dark only for the ignorant ones.</em></strong></p>
<p><br>
  Therefore, it is important to know  that regardless of the manifestation of our gender and that of our sexual partner,  regardless of <strong><em>our erotic inclination (innate all the same)</em></strong>, what each one  really seeks is the realization and the counterbalance of the female and the  male principle within himself, the synthesis of duality and its transcendence. <br>
  <br>
  Any classification of people  according to <strong><em>the manifestation of their erotic life</em></strong> or any other criterion  is by definition inept, since it constitutes a product of mental processing, the  outcome of our partial awareness of the Human Whole. The human mind often has  the tendency to persist in the partial. In reality there are no homo-, hetero-,  bi-sexuals or any other category. The abolition of any classification, sorting  out, or evaluation of people will lead us to recognizing that every being constitutes  by itself an entire, distinct category, a manifestation of the divine energy.<br>

            <p>The truth is always more  simple than the one we weave in our minds.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a41"></a>42</strong></span><strong>. </strong>In every incarnation of his, man  returns to earth in order to explore a specific manifestation of Gender, and  when his choice is such as to absorb all his attention during his lifetime, this  means that amongst other things, he chose to study the very meaning of Gender  itself in depth.<br> 
              </p>
            <p><strong><em>The deplorable laws of  society &ndash; outcome neither of hygiene nor of judgment &ndash; diminished my work. They  tied my expression down. They hindered me from giving light and emotion to  those who are made like me.</em></strong></p>
            <p><br>
              The important thing is for someone  not to fight against his self, not to try to &quot;outdo&quot; it, but to come to know it and after that to cooperate with it, in order to achieve the best possible  result. Unfortunately, people spend many efforts and exertion in &quot;changing&quot;,  without realizing that the specific materialized form has a reason for existence;  to contribute to the accomplishment of our life here, and that, if they consumed  the equivalent energy in developing what they have, without identifying, then  they would accomplish much greater happiness.<br>
              <br>
              As we have said before, the way is  not predetermined as a choice, but the crossroads through which one will pass,  are. The choices will form a final course &ndash; this happens with the  &quot;formation&quot; of the body as well, man's material image: the main characteristics  are predetermined as necessary road signs, but the final formation is achieved  after man's successive choices and his ways of handling things.</p>
            <p>And this, naturally, is not valid for the form only.  Let us not forget that our destination has a unique aim for each one of us. So  let us also accept that even our character, has been formed in such a way so  the attainment of this aim be feasible. Let us not deny our special characteristics, because  through them we shall be capable of serving what we love the most.<br>

              It is inevitable for<strong><em> those  who engage in somewhat healthy love, by remaining within what is strictly  permitted, to make stupid correlations</em></strong>. The man who has not known and  loved (his) Self, has the need to entrench himself inside shapes in order to  justify his ignorance to his self and conceal his fears. Life patterns are  nothing but the results of fear that actually amplify the existence of fear  instead of abolishing it. Because, when you compete with something, then this grows  and is consolidated, since it feeds on your own mental power. So, <strong><em>those chattering about morals </em></strong>let  the dark forces  misguide them to evaluations that adulterate the Truth.<br>
              <br>
The soul is not sanctified by deeds  of the body but by deeds of the soul.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong><em><br>
              Tonight it crossed my mind  to write about my love. And yet I will not do so. How powerful prejudice is. I  was liberated from it; but I am thinking of the enslaved ones under whose sight  this paper may come.</em></strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Man is called to match <strong><em>the deplorable  laws of society</em></strong>, against the Great Laws of the Universe; only then &ndash; <strong><em>in  the most perfect society</em></strong><em> &ndash;</em> <strong><em>will  he appear certain and act freely</em>.</strong> Besides, without the strengthening of  the <em>&quot;I am&quot;,</em> no correlation can be built.<br>
              <br>
                <br>
                <strong><em><br>
                Do not speak of guilt, do  not speak of responsibility. When the Regiment of Pleasure passes by with music  and flags; when the senses quiver and tremble, whoever stands apart, whoever  does not dash into the good campaign, the one leading to the conquest of  pleasures and passions is foolish and irreverent. </em></strong><br>
                <br>
              <strong><em>All the laws of morality &ndash;  badly understood, badly applied &ndash; are zero and cannot stand up even for a  moment, when the Regiment of Pleasure passes by with music and flags.</em></strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The man who walks freely on the tracks  of the Self-God, knows that the only thing that is important is his work on the  way of Love and Union, and nothing else exists  besides this. <br>
                <br>
                What, therefore, man must do is to  escape from the static state of the mind's dependence and proceed to the  disengagement, without going against whatever his heart dictates to him. He  is called to follow what he wants, without the censorship of social mind and  without inhibitions, without remorse and externally incumbent life patterns,  because often the barriers he sets up do not belong to the Eternal Laws, but are hidden fears.<br>
                <br>
                The feeling of joy and desire, this  will be the guide for what &quot;must&quot; be for us and let us not fight to install an  establishment autocratically because reason dictates that it is the most  correct one. After all, more correct or wrong does not exist, because each  person's life is conscripted &ndash; whether he has realized it or not &ndash; into a specific  road which dictates all the partial conditions.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><em>Do not let a single shadowy virtue hold you back. Do  not believe that a single obligation binds you. (&hellip;). Your duty is to enlist as  a faithful soldier, with simplicity of heart, when the Regiment of Pleasure  passes by with music and flags.</em></strong>

            <p><a name="la_aiv_1"></a>The body is not subject to laws  inviolable and common to everybody. This means that we must neither  overestimate its presence, nor protect it excessively, but  use it to such an extent so as to  advance the matters of the soul. A garment which is not worn out does not  necessarily mean a provident person, but often an inert and cowardly owner.  Therefore, let us use our body in accord with our immaterial self and for its  own sake. We should not fight against our self, we should not try to impose on it  characteristics which do not belong to it, because this disorientates us more  than what we are afraid we must not do &quot;because they are not right&quot;. We  must go along together with our self and support it.<br>
                <br>
              And if something displeases us, we  must neither consume ourselves in evaluations and guilt, nor in the effort to stop   it displeasing us and to accept it axiomatically, but we should move  creatively and act in the direction of its change and its replacement with  something that would satisfy us. God has assigned to us our field full of  thorns and stones, and we must not accept it &ndash; something that most of the time  is a disguised fear &ndash; but  work in order to make it fertile and beautiful.  After all, real love is a power of transforming everything,  and not of immobilization on one level and of  preservation of a form, even when this is given by  God. God embodies the capability of its evolution in every form, and man,  moving out of love and working patiently, is called on to develop it. </p>
            <p>Therefore, let us not fear changes; just  examine our motives, sanctify them, purify our dreams and entrust the  continuation to our Holy Collaborators, our guides and Masters, who tirelessly  and lavishly guide us, through our Conscience.<br>

              Let us advance in life following  our heart, even when our inner voice guides us  to paths hidden from the majority of people and to evaluations different from  whatever is in effect in social life. Let us not forget that we must not name  relationships, because only God has named. Let us seek the name that God gave  us, therefore, and that is the name of Love.<br>
              <br>
Like the atoms, which interlace  with each other and shape more complex accumulations  of matter, or the stars, which join in groups of galaxies, the same happens  with man: during his course man assimilates other energies, im-personal ones  from the environment, or even personal ones,  i.e. entities which  resemble his nature, without them being on the same level as him so as to have  an autonomous existence, and in that way he unites in a constantly more  expanded existence. This goes on also after the transition from this lives'  cycle to the next, where human souls, depending on the people they have loved,  unite into more powerful bodies with widened consciousness, condensed power  and expanded action. This will become better understood, when people are able  to comprehend the evolutionary course of the Universe.<br>
<br>
From dematerialization onwards,  there exists  the &quot;we&quot; only. Encounters are made constantly and constantly each  one becomes one with each other. Souls entangle with each other like the  branches of a tree. We are one and everybody. That is also why people on earth unite and  separate countless times, an unavoidable process until they succeed the final  stage of the definite union.<br>
<br>
The sacrament of matrimony is so  important technically too for the official religion and the social institutions  as much as for the people, as imposed by their inner voice, instinct, because  it symbolizes and subconsciously reminds people of their ulterior aim. Universal sacraments are inscribed in the subconscious and appear in people's  life even if they do not comprehend the reason for their existence according to   earthly data.<br>
<br>
People, who  get married, experience the specific side of their relationship, pieces of  which they have already experienced in previous lives, meaning other types of  relationships. The relationship of a couple is the antechamber where an  existing relationship is being judged, and if it succeeds, then the companions proceed  to the real Union, the common Life, the perfect Co-living.<br>

              Our need for our own person is usually shadowed by our denial to recognize it.  Insecurity, antagonism and rivalry, which characterized our relationships in  previous life cycles, appear intense in the present cycle as well, driving us  to one more energy loss, a separation. On the other hand, the realisation of  the uniting is dictated imperatively by the nature of the Soul, that is why we  exchange the <strong><em>&quot;for ever&quot;</em></strong> from the first moment:<br>
