              The words of Jesus  are filled with messages of euphoria. Let us study the Scriptures. Hellenism  and Christianity are two very strong Initiations; let us go back to their  Sources, let us keep them by our side. <br>
              <br>
              Ancient Greek  mythology contains many symbolisms we can keep  ourselves occupied with. Ancient Greeks  were an enlightened people, who lived in a favourable era, as many Masters were  close by the Earth, at that particular longitude and latitude. Sciences were also  found to flourish and many questions can be answered if one looks back to these  sources. It is important for  modern Greeks to get to know that particular  period of their History, which is why today  many people  are involved with  great affection for it.</p>
            <p>Let us also open up  the texts of the Masters, as conveyed by Blavatsky, Bailey, and so many other disciples; the <a href="../afos/Haich/index_en.htm" class="la">"Initiation" by Elisabeth Haich</a>, <a href="../afos/Gavrilia/index_en.htm" class="la">Mother Gavrilia's "the Ascetic of Love"</a>.  Let  us listen to their Voice in <a href="../Jung/index_en.htm" class="la">Basilides' dictation to Jung</a>; in the letters they dictated to Roger de Pins. Let us meet up with Their  Word, as conveyed to the world of people by the <a href="../afos/Aivanhov/index_en.htm" class="la">Master Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov</a> himself, or  <a href="../afos/Lobsang Ramba/index_en.htm" class="la">Master Rampa</a>, who came from the Powerful and Holy Land. These Masters are still close  to Earth and are included in the mission of the Hierarchy concerning Earth. </p>
            <p>Let us study the <a href="../afos/Ourania Profitia/index_en.htm" class="la">insights of the &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; </a>and work on them practically. Let us look into  fairytales, allowing  the language of symbols guide us to the unsurpassable truths.<br>

                <td><p><em><strong>Whatever we portrayed as beautiful and correct,</strong></em><br>
                  <em><strong>the enemies will prove to be ludicrous and superfluous,</strong></em><br>
                  <em><strong>repeating the same things differently (without much effort).</strong></em><br>

              Wherever we may  seek the Truth, we will find it undivided and unique &ndash; suffice we are seeking it  with a spirit of convergence. The New Age will be marked by the Knowledge that  will accompany Faith in People's hearts. We, people, shall carry on along the  rugged road, feeling confidence in His Presence, which is the Second Coming  within the Soul. <br>
              <br>
  Humanity will discover that the Laws are  principles of the Eternal Movement, and that Metaphysics, as they call it, by no means  accidentally, is what will be discovered, or rather re-discovered by the  science of Physics. The road is one, and the path carved, and the principles have  already been incubated in the spirit of the researchers. </p>
            <p><a name="la_io_1"></a>The world  in the New  Age will discover the Esoteric Path. Through  silence and  unobtrusiveness, it will be led back to primary life, that  which it lost when the waters covered the surface of the Earth. However, those who left, did so only physically, and left humanity to travel the way again from the beginning, so as  to avoid the same outcome this time. Technological maturity  was unable to prevent a fatal development, that is why psychological maturity is  now needed. Those people come back to cancel the bad result, and to be able to  pass the Gates of Heaven again. This is what the &quot;original sin&quot; is talking about symbolically: people's psychological immaturity that led them to their destruction at that time, not totally of course, but a reduction to a starting point from which, through a new route, they could find Terrestrial life again as it functioned before, namely to return, symbolically, back to Heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
The time has come for this new path to be carved. Through us all who function, consciously or not, at this level, the will to return to the &quot;in His likeness&quot; will take action. You  see, man kept the &quot;image&quot; to guide him in the difficult initial stages of the  effort for evolution from the beginning, upon the remains of a life, which was  erased through huge natural disasters. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Commenting on a book of Ruskin, the Poet wrote:</p>
<p><br>
    <strong><em><br>
    This speed and the many and wonderful inventions are not redundant. Ruskin  makes the mistake of considering them as the end, whereas they are only a means.  And they serve this Utopia of his. &quot;The step of the clouds&quot;, abbreviating  distances and increasing and accentuating people's solidarity, quickens the  coming of the kingdom &ndash; &quot;Kingdom of peace&quot; &ndash; which was prophesied by the poets  of past centuries and for which the poets of today are still waiting, full of  hope, with eyes fixed on the horizon, where one morning golden towers and walls  of gold will come into view.</em></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><br>
  The New civilization will be reborn in its homeland. <br>
  <br>
  Let us get to know and  love this homeland, the country we chose for earthly mother, as a cradle of a higher Communion. The new people are already being born and have been born in this  specific era, because it is the Age when the Memory will be awakened, and the  barrier of Time will break.<br>
  <br>
  In this New Age the gap, which greed and selfishness created in Time will be healed. The Beast is the cumbersome Matter, which bound the Spirit and deprived it of its capacities of access in Time-space. Those who  do not know the Immortal, will fight on the side of stagnation, but the wings  will be given to those who defy fear and open their eyes to Infinity. <br>
  <br>
  Many bright Spirits  are already working so as to guide the mortal species back to its beginnings. Many will work at the base, without being noticed. And when the base is consolidated, then the wave of transformation will surge, that will look like a new  Cataclysm, to clean up the lands where the Sons of God used to live before, as  a nation of Giants. Then, the Return to the Promised Land, the Land of Light,  Hellas (= land of sunlight) will have been completed. Then, Helios (= the Sun)  will return to Earth. Then, the voices will cease and the Word will be heard.  Then, everybody will be rebaptized with the names of the Truth, and Thought  will be transparent, as it was before it hid inside the darkness and opacity of the  Mind. Then, eyes will determine motion.<br>
  <br>
  The &quot;Kings&quot;, who  fled to the Solar System, will be re-established in the common body of the  Nation. It is not that long until Tranquility returns.</p>
<p>Let us seek the Truth  where its sign exists. Let us forsake our self and devote ourselves to the  road. Soon there will be no mystery, because Science will be revealed in its entirety,  meaning the Knowledge of the Entire World. </p>
<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a65"></a>66</strong></span><strong>. </strong>The messages of the  Masters to the world of people grow and more and more people will perceive  their presence. They will interpret it as the Voice of the Angels, or the voice  of (their) Self, or a sign of God, or Jesus' return, as He had foretold &ndash; and  all these are correct.<br>
  <br>
The distribution of  balance will change. The silent Force will manifest itself. The new Tree will  spread out deep roots in the ground and the rain will strengthen it until it becomes  tall and strong.<br>
<br>
Let us believe nothing  other than the words of Jesus, the words of God. It is easy for the seed of  panic and despair to grow in the soul whose soil is fear; therefore, let us not fear  and not get carried away by the words of the pseudo-prophets and allegedly  interpreters of the holy Word. &nbsp;</p>
Whoever thinks he knows  the Way of His Reappearance,  he is the one far from Him, because nobody knows the steps of  the Being on the tracks of His Father's Creation. Whoever expects to recognize  His New Face among the darkness of violence,  he is the one who has no eyes to face Him. Whoever preserves  fear and anguish in his heart,  he is the one who has not made the cradle where He will be  reborn.<br>

            <p>This age is an age of  Birth. It is not the time for profit but for investment. Our effort has special  value now that the circumstances are obscure. Let us hear within us the new which  is coming. When it speaks to us, let us not refuse it; besides, everything has  begun to form the final configuration. As long as our choice carries on, the Birth  continues to be routed on the higher planes. The people who will collaborate in the rebirth, approach us. We see it and we should  expect it. Let us talk to those who ask us to, through our words the new world,  which will shortly rise, will speak. Our work will be  foundational, without it being about a  rally of a practical nature, however. We throw the seeds of  awakening and they germinate.<br>

              We ought to steel  our character and allow ourselves to reach the Supreme Communion with those who  guide us; train our mind to be silent when the inner feelings speak, because  they bring us close to the Truth with which we ought to live. Among everything that  appears in our way, let us trust first and foremost the Voice that connects us  to those who wish for mankind to return to its primary bliss. <br>
              <br>
              Let us not seek in  external organizations, because there, it is not easy to find the pure, crystal  clear light that guides us. The course of the true Warriors of God's Love is  where the Sun illuminates without shadow. <br>
              <br>
              Let us follow in the  steps one by one, without haste, because the edifice of the New Age should be  based on solid foundations, which will not be shaken again, as the power of the people  grows. And we ourselves must acquire absolute control over our self, support  him so as not to be overwhelmed by the vibrations of the birth of the New.<br>
              <br>
  Wherever there is the path of God imprinted,  nothing can be an obstacle. Let us trust that everything that has been foreseen  will be materialized easily when the right time  comes. Until then, we should let  go  in the present and let  us experience it with certainty and ease, because whatever the Word has said,  it already lives behind our eyes.<br>
  <br>
  Let us pray for bright spirits to be  incarnated on Earth, which will mark the road towards Completeness! <br>
