Becoming conscious, on an  earthly level, follows an intense emotional processing. So, we understand that  emotions play an especially important role in the evolution of the soul,  therefore we must not seek apathy. The more man ascends, all the more sensitive his  psychism becomes and is wounded more easily. We must not identify this with a   weakness  of the soul but with a change in the spectrum of vibrations: becoming  easily emotional is a characteristic of expansion of the field of man's  identification; it presupposes a course that goes way back for the human soul and  leads towards actions of assistance and solidarity.<br>

            <p><em>Apathy</em> is a state that most people  identify with heartlessness. Apathy is, on the contrary, a mental state  of  full vigilance and sensitivity, conscious sym-pathy*, but at the same time a  state of disidentifying with those issues that block the mind and the body. In  other words, for someone to be apathetic means that he actively participates in  the earthly scenarios of life which unfold around him or within him too and he  invests thought and emotion in them, but at the same time he recognizes their  temporary nature. So, apathy protects him from the corrosion of the  core of his existence, and makes him realize that he belongs to eternity, while  what suffers, is his material side, the one he borrowed from the material  universe, in order to build the &quot;temple of his soul&quot;, the organ which will  materialize the melody of his spirit in the specific life.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<span class="notes">(* The word comes from the  Greek verb &quot;sympascho&quot; which derives from the prefix &quot;syn-&quot; 
that means  &quot;together with&quot;, where the &quot;n&quot; before the following word becomes &quot;m&quot;, and the  verb &quot;pascho&quot;, which means &quot;I suffer&quot;. Therefore the word &quot;sympathia&quot; means the  state of the soul where it suffers together with someone.) </span></p>
            <p>Therefore, be careful of all those  who use apathy in order to legitimize heartlessness. Apathy works even  subconsciously for those who believe in Eternal Life, whenever they are in some  phases embroiled in earthly turmoil. We must not seek it, then, because it acts  even without our order as a safety valve, which protects the soul from panic.  Let us not be afraid to experience deeply whatever  comes up on our way, because  then we will have used our earthly thisness correctly and fully.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>Without enthusiasm &ndash; within  enthusiasm I include rage &ndash; mankind cannot work. But in a fit of enthusiasm it  does not work well. The enthusiasm must pass in order for it to work  effectively, but even then &ndash; in the sober condition &ndash; it accomplishes deeds,  which derive from the period of enthusiasm. Whoever becomes highly  enthusiastic, can not do a good job; neither can he, who never becomes  enthusiastic.</em></strong>            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We must experience the emotions  that are being created within us as much as we can, because every emotion is useful  and besides, this is actually the reason for our return to earth. Let us not be  afraid of sorrow or pain, because there are no &quot;bad&quot; emotions: bad is the  absence of good, therefore bad is the absence of emotions, the inertia of the soul,  insensibility, heartlessness. The man who feels is the man who lives, so long  as he does not identify his deeper existence with the experiencing of emotional  situations. And it is natural for this experiencing to move within  the whole range of the soul&rsquo;s emotions. Let us contemplate every emotion as a  colour, and let us consider how monotonous  life would be if we saw  everything only as red or green. When we combine all of them we shall reach  white &ndash; the world, which we <strong><em>created</em></strong> will <strong><em>be as a whole transformed into  pure emotion for us</em></strong> &ndash; and that is the emotional condition of <em>apathy</em> &ndash; but this concerns another life.<br>
              <br>
              Therefore, let us not censor,  but   not identify with, either.<br>

              In olden days Shakespeare had condensed  the <em>&quot;</em><strong><em>Good  and Bad</em></strong><em> <strong>weather</strong>&quot;</em> into the phrase &quot;nothing is bad, if thinking doesn't  make it so&quot; and before him Epictetus: &quot;it's not things themselves that upset  people, but the doctrines about them&quot;.<br>

            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a31"></a>31</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Emotions are the extract of experiences, which the  soul brings with it from the Beginning of the World, and they have the  character of primordial power. We are used to attributing the emotion to the  sub-ject that functioned stimulatingly, so as to emerge from the subconscious,  but this is wrong. Just like a catalyst acts as a means for two chemical  substances to react, in this way the sub-ject also acts as a catalyst which  finally creates an emotion.</p>
            <p>In reality nothing derives from  outside: &quot;crises&quot; derive from our own self, which has not found balance.  Identifying with the self, meaning the coincidence of the inner voice  with consciousness is the one that brings tranquility and peace of the soul.  Then, man feels strengthened and no external stimulus can upset him. Besides,  external stimuli are the cause and not the reason for the internal state. Even individuals,  humans, are neither capable of changing the course of the soul's orbit in the slightest,  nor of influencing the fluctuation of the soul&rsquo;s energy, except only if they  are purposely used as a cause for it.<br>

              When you love, you yourself are the  responsible one, <em>the creator of your emotion</em>, and the other person is simply he, with whose contribution this  emotion is being drawn up to the surface. Even if he is absent, you will be  able to create the same feeling again, because you are the one responsible for  it; he has simply been the pretext, and pretexts may be given from many  external factors. So, whoever is capable of loving, always finds &quot;something&quot;  onto which to project this love, and under no circumstances is the person who does  not love, going to be worthy of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
            </p>
<p><a name="la_ga_4"></a>Certainly, love can not be  restrained by anything. Whether we decide to love someone or not,  does not  depend on any factor of the &quot;external&quot; world &ndash; as, for instance, whether this  person accepts this role we are attributing to him, whether it is socially  acceptable or &quot;proper&quot;, etc. &ndash; and when <strong><em>between us fate has placed a terrible  barrier: unrelenting generations of interpreters and experts</em>,</strong> most  mistakes are made exactly at this point:  instead of facing the world as a  mirror of their self, people reverse the situation and they themselves become the  mirrors of the world &ndash; which is none other than their lower self, since it  constitutes an impure jumble of tendencies, points of view, moods and every  kind of &quot;complexity&quot; that moves away from the One. </p>

            <p>The reverse movement &ndash; from the  point to the infinite &ndash; describes the world of anti-spirit, namely of  matter, from the moment of the Big Bang onwards. But even each and every event  of our life that we experience and until we conquer it  conscience wise, follows  this very spiral course. In the largest diameter emotions are many and intense,  more &quot;dramatic&quot;, and the more awareness deepens, the smaller the  circumference of the circle becomes, so as to end in the apathy of the moment  (point), where all things partial and opposite are contained,  potentially, i.e. condensed  in apathy. <br>
              <br>
              This is the point of apathy, the  top <strong><em>of  the rugged mountain</em>,</strong> the point of Love. The man who reaches it  completes the cycle he had started with his first incarnation, finishes his  course on the earthly dimension and passes over to another level of beingness.  The soul returns to the point, the One, on the analogy of the return of the  universe to the point of its birth, to that hyper-dense moment, where all its  mass was concentrated in one point.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>&quot;We are standing slightly  higher than the so-called &quot;developed people&quot;, meaning the perfect spiritual  growth has made us simple again, but simple without ignorance. We have completed  the whole cycle. Consequently, we naturally returned to the first point. The  others stayed half way. They neither know, nor surmise where the road ends&quot;. </em></strong><strong><em><br> 
            </em></strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>Perfect spiritual growth  has made us simple again</em>,</strong> because man becomes simple, when his consciousness spreads,  broadens, expands, which are qualities of the Spirit. This man is the &quot;infant&quot; according  to Jesus, the &quot;child&quot; according to Heraclitus. &quot;I praise you,  Father, Lord of  heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned,  and revealed them to little children&quot; (&hellip;) &quot;because it is given to them to know  the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven&quot;, (Matthew 11:25, 13:11). Symbolically,  this is the course of man from Adam up to Jesus, from Homo Sapiens up to Homo  Deus, the Man-God. <br>
              <br>
              The man who feels that the world,  his inner universe, which <strong><em>he</em></strong> himself <strong><em>created</em></strong>, <strong><em>has as a whole been transformed  into pure emotion for him</em>,</strong> has touched the hyper-dense point of Love,  the borders of his godly nature, and starts  experiencing it. He knows that the  specific feeling he experiences every single moment is indispensable to him in  order to ascend to apathy, with the meaning of the hyper-abridgment of the  emotions. He is at that point of his ascent, where the top of the mountain is  beginning to be revealed in front of his eyes and he knows that he is walking  towards it. &nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Accuracy and epigrammatic  completeness of Poetry &ndash; <strong><em>you as a whole have been transformed into  pure emotion for me</em></strong> &ndash; meets the science of Physics: &quot;The completely  different kinds of particles&quot;, Hawking says, &quot;which we observe at low energies  are in fact found to be all the same type of particle, only in different  states. At high energies all these particles behave similarly. The effect is  rather like the behaviour of a roulette ball on a roulette wheel. At high  energies (when the wheel is spun quickly) the ball behaves in essentially only  one way &ndash; it rolls round and round. But as the wheel slows, the energy of the  ball decreases, and eventually the ball drops into one of the thirty-seven  slots in the wheel.<br>
              <br>
              In other words, at low  energies there are thirty-seven different states in which the ball can exist.  If, for some reason, we could only observe the ball at low energies, we would  then think that there were thirty-seven different types of ball!<br>
              <br>
              At some very high energy,  called the Grand Unification energy, all these forces would have the same  strength and so could just be different aspects of a single force. At this  energy the different matter particles, would also all be essentially the same&quot;.<br>
              <br>
              Then man is identified with all  sides of his self: any side of his self that may emerge from the succession of  the external events, is acceptable to him, and he can find joy in it. Like <strong><em>the  old mirror which had seen and seen again</em>, </strong>/<strong> <em>during its many years of existence</em>,</strong> /<strong> <em>thousands of things and faces</em>, </strong>he has accepted, loved, and  included everybody and everything in the unity of his self, since he has  successively experienced all the situations of the soul and has composed them within  himself.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a32"></a>32</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Man functions within an  energy spectrum. We could liken it to a musical octave. If he constantly  remained on one note, life would be monotonous, but also tiring, since movement  ensures the successive functioning of all the muscle, nervous, mental systems  and their successive deactivation-relaxation. Within the eternity of the  Universe, the spiral evolution-alteration safeguards the normal development of  life. If we look back to the universal laws,  we shall find the wisdom there.  Let us not seek a standstill in an emotion or a situation, then, because this  contravenes the laws of Harmony. We must be ready to follow the changes, to  flow into things, with the certainty of a fish when it lets itself go freely  with the sea&rsquo;s currents.<br>

              When we feel melancholy, we do not  always need to look for some logical reason: we may simply have to vibrate on a  different &quot;note&quot; of the universal scale, so that our body loosens up. Let us  simply experience every moment as we feel it, without trying to blackmail emotions;  yet, as we know, emotion is the most genuine expression of the connection  with the Universal Soul.<br>
              <br>
The important thing is to separate  fatigue from denial. The antidote to fatigue, usually, is found in something  simple:</p>
            <p><strong><em>No matter how rundown you are,  no matter how many distresses are pressuring you, when you go out and walk  around a plain of the City or along a seashore you feel that you were somewhat  relieved &ndash; the Soul of the Byzantine Nature whispers to you &quot;God will provide&quot;.  I vividly felt this influence on the night which I describe.</em></strong></p>
            <p>The more man's life is enlightened,  he realizes that even the most difficult conditions do not cause him sorrow or  depression any longer, but joy for life, eros and ecstasy for the  Creation. <br>
              <br>
              He then experiences true <em>happiness</em>. Often people confuse this  situation of the soul with feelings which concern the ethereal body: firstly,  happiness should not be identified with joy or satisfaction or enthusiasm;  these are emotions, and as such they have the following characteristics which  oppose the concept of happiness, transience and dependence on causes. Happiness  is characterized by perpetuity, meaning  it is beyond time, since it is a  situation concerning the soul and therefore it has the same characteristics as  it, meaning it is not subject to the dimensions of time and space.  Therefore, neither does it depend on any fact &ndash; event in time-space &ndash;, and that is  why it is dissociated from the emotions, which are products of the self that is subsumed in  time-space  and which are directly dependent on the movement of manifested  man (namely his &quot;material&quot; side) in the also manifested world and  his interaction with it.<br>
            </p>
            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">
              <tr>
                <td><p><strong><em>(&hellip;) When  happiness comes</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>it gives less  joy</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>than what one  expects. However</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>this has been  clearly gained: we were spared from hopes</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>and  expectations.</em></strong></p></td>
              </tr>
          </table>
            <p><br>
              The <strong><em>living and warm happiness</em></strong> is, therefore, a much wider state, and can function as a basis on which all  emotions are manifested each time, even the most &quot;unpleasant&quot; ones, such as  sorrow, pain, anxiety, fear. This basis,  not only does not hinder their  manifestation, but on the contrary it allows them to reach their full size because it is presupposed that man's essence lies beyond separations, in the hyperconcentrated One, where as  a matter of fact countless different hues and kinds of emotions,   potentially exist. No manifestation of any emotion influences the basis, since it  is about two different levels. Let us look at the sea: no matter how much the  wind may be blowing and raising huge waves, the bottom remains still and  unchangeable.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>How daring not to stay in  the high emotional importance of the world. And to beautify it, and work for it  as you did before. Even if it is only the surface, which you see as you stand  and which you have to deal with and &ndash; ignorant as you are and do not forget it &ndash;  it may have an importance which it does not name, but humanity instinctively feels  it and so do you when you are healthy. </em></strong></p>
            <p>When we seek happiness, first of  all let us not identify it with situations that have no relation to it.  Besides, the man who does not feel sorrow or anxiety is not happy, but rather  dead, because he will equally be able to feel neither joy, nor tranquility, nor  any other emotion. After all, experiencing happiness on another level, will be  the one to colour with interest &ndash; so too, by extension with &ldquo;joy&rdquo; &ndash; even an  incident which brought sorrow and distress.<br>
              <br>
              Real unhappiness is the devitalization,  i.e. the repression of the functioning of the centres of the heart  (emotions) and of the throat (communication).</p>
The man who has found happiness, even when <strong><em>temporary  calamities torment him </em></strong>lives <strong><em>with the joy of imperishability in his eyes</em>. </strong> </div></td>
