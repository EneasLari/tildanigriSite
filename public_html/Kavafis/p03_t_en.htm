            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a07"></a>7</strong></span><strong>. </strong>In earthly life, the first mirrors  of our Conscience, the place where we shall see our fear reflected, are our  fellow human beings; that is why human relationships are also a great lesson  and common to everybody. All negative feelings (anger, jealousy, sorrow,  hatred), which will be drawn out from within ourselves through our interaction with people,  are none other than manifestations of Fear. In other words, their root is   lack,  absence of Love.<br>
              <br>
              Every time a person provokes us, drawing out a negative feeling from within ourselves, let us contemplate that in fact this person has become the mirror which reflects a certain pending  issue of our soul and in this way he subdues us into the process of realizing  it and facing it. Fellow human beings are our co-workers in the completion of  the work towards our Self. If our aim is to come to know our self and unite with It, then the exchange of energies with people is a valuable helper in this  effort of ours to agitate the subconscious and with the sorting out.</p>
In the largest part of our course, fear dominates  our relationships with people, because we fear the still unknown sides of our  self. For as long as we are not ready to diagnose and cure our fears, we build <strong><em>an  excellent suit of armour</em></strong> around ourselves<strong> </strong>and each one of us becomes an <strong><em>Emilyan Monae</em></strong>:<br>

            <p><br>
              We often define fear  ourselves, as long as we name whatever in  particular  causes us fear. We are trapped in fear, for however long we grant  others the power and the capability to  threaten us.<br>
              <br>

            <p><br>
              Nobody has such a power or  capability since we do not provide it to him mentally. In reality we  &quot;project&quot; an action to him that we ourselves take against our self, we use him  as a mirror, where we truly see our person &quot;threatening&quot; our self. In other  words, we project our fear to the other that such a thing can happen and in  this way we make him capable of carrying it out. At times, we even &quot;force&quot; him  to do it, by strongly projecting this negative thought of ours onto him, while he himself  would not undertake such a thing on his own. <strong><em>They will want to harm me</em></strong>,  Emilyan Monae anticipates. <br>
              <br>
              The more we project the threat  against ourselves to the people around us, the more we become unable to love  them, because we bind them to the reflection of a negative emanation, we burden  them with  deeds of negative return and we immobilize them in behaviours,  which serve specific aims we have designed for our self.<br>
              <br>
  <strong><em>With words, with  physiognomy and with manners the sovereign  from Western Libya</em></strong> also built his suit of armour.&nbsp; Out of fear that he is not worthy  of being loved for what he is, he lost his identity, making a desperate effort  to construct and maintain his misery.<br>

            <p><br>
              <a name="la_ty_1"></a>The suit of armour of the sovereign  is built on imitation. Fear cultivates the illusion of resemblance in people  and drives them to be subordinated, consciously or unconsciously, to the  command of simulation. Out of the desire to coexist harmoniously with fellow  human beings, they take refuge in imitation, renouncing the responsibility of  uniqueness, but in reality, <strong><em>they desecrate Nature. </em></strong>Until man  becomes consciously aware of his uniqueness, he will use other people's criteria in  order to judge and decide for his own life, he will compare his life according  to  data of  earthly parameters and he will get carried away by life  plans that are in force for other people. <br>
              <br>
Arrogance is the daughter of shame; praises are not needed any more to those who wished to grow up. The <strong><em>sovereign </em></strong>makes do with the <strong><em>rather</em></strong> <strong><em>good</em></strong><em> <strong>impression</strong></em>,  provided that <strong><em>he accepts the honours</em></strong> of people, all the more so <strong><em>gladly</em>, </strong>because he is not ready yet to claim what he really yearns: their love. <strong><em>He  faces in this way the wicked people</em></strong><em>,</em> that<em> <strong>fortuitous</strong></em><strong>, <em>silly</em> <em>man</em>,</strong> reminding us also of that  other young man, who had ensured the <strong><em>favour of Alexander Valas </em></strong>and<strong> <em>didn't  get upset by losing a silly victory</em>, </strong>because he knew that irrespective  of the struggle's outcome, <strong><em>if he had secretly commanded it </em>- </strong>/<strong> <em>the flatterers, would have given first prize  even to his crippled chariot</em>. </strong><br>
<br>
Praises are not love; Conscience  knows this. Earthly man, however, overlooks it as long as he still needs the  falsehood of praise and people's confirmation. And while within himself he knows  the truth: that<strong> <em>a wheel broke</em>, </strong>that<strong> <em>he was coarse</em>, </strong>that<strong> <em>he  lost a victory</em>, </strong>it is important to him to appear <strong><em>first</em></strong> in people's eyes, <strong><em>to be  the young man most glorified</em>. </strong>And the sovereign feels he is<em> <strong>bored</strong></em> and is not happy, <strong><em>but his soul</em></strong><em> <strong>trembles lest he chance to lose</strong></em> his  suit of armour and the truth be revealed. </p>
In his effort to keep the armour of imitation, he  expands fear. The lie becomes so convenient and convincing, until some moment,  when he loses track of his way; he forgets when he constructed his suit of armour  and why. And at some point in time he stops feeling that he is wearing the armour,  stops being conscious of his misery. He then considers it natural to have lost  his self, without even suspecting that he <strong><em>desecrated </em></strong>his <strong><em>Nature</em></strong>.
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a08"></a>8</strong></span><strong>. </strong>On the face of two other  characteristic carriers of a suit of armour, the <strong><em>Christian bishop Pegasius</em></strong> and <strong><em>the  Christian princeling Julian</em></strong>, we clearly see that the more we try to  protect ourselves, the more it makes us suffer, because we become the prey of  suspicion and fear and we move away from love and unity.              <br>

              <br>
This delusion of the two-sided  deception is, moreover, betrayed  by the <strong><em>boastful words </em></strong>of Emilyan  Monae: he believes that he will manage to <strong><em>deceive</em></strong> people, a conviction his  mind built; because arrogance is a characteristic of the mind, and not of the  heart. That is why we always call forth an intellectual fabrication in order to  justify our fears towards our self or boast of the effectiveness of our suit  of armour:<br>

              In this way, it is possible in the  earthly kingdom for a man to climb up to the highest ranks. However, in the  spiritual Hierarchy of creatures, where <strong><em>no fortune-hunter can</em></strong><em> <strong>fool  the Legislators, </strong></em>he lies just as low as he is far from love and the  truth of his existence. The mark for the setting of the boundaries of our  internal evolution, in our course towards Perfection, is given exclusively and  only by our ability to love. And only then does man become capable of loving,  when even the smallest trace of fear is lost from within. Even the smallest  trace of the sense of threat, of insecurity and of sense of vulnerability can destroy any love. <br>
              <br>
              The armours of fear are as many and different as people are. But they all have a common characteristic: the fact that the man who wears them is not in unity  with his self. Unity means <em>becoming  conscious</em>. The man who lives in dissociation and duality <strong><em>sleeps  conscienceless, quiet, and happy</em>,</strong> just like <strong><em>Nero</em>,</strong> and can become an  unintentional generator of great disaster, like <strong><em>the young Greek sophist</em></strong> in the palace <strong><em>of Salome</em></strong>:<br>

              They smile, indifferent and  cruel, </em></strong>although <strong><em>happy</em>,</strong> the non-conscious  people, the ones who are still in the first stages of evolution. The small past of the human soul's  course entails a &quot;cruel&quot; psychism, because the earthly  human being is kneaded with the basic characteristic of matter: &nbsp;hardness.<br>
              <br>
              The light of the soul is still too  weak to penetrate the thick matter of the bodies of earthly man and to outflank  the loss. <strong><em>Desires for matter and love for the positive deceive him</em>. </strong>He  transforms the universal energy into low, material vibrations and only through  his conscious-lower self. That is why he completely identifies with earthly  life and its manifestations. <strong><em>He judges through logic</em>, </strong>which<strong> </strong>is<strong> <em>his blind sickness and he believes</em> <em>only what he sees; but delusion and injustice  is his judgment</em>. </strong>His inflexible intellectual structures are hardly  influenced or turned around. He lives in the narrow limits of a &quot;personal&quot; life  and the &quot;ego&quot; is concerned with its problems only.<br>
              <br>
              His consciousness is confined, as  it is found constantly focused on the outside world, on the forms that surround  him, on his feelings and thought, on the materialization of his earthly desires.  The centripetal power of the &quot;ego&quot; urges his soul towards compulsory  experiences, by self-invalidating the right of free will: his earthly desires  are bonds for his soul, they possess him, they cover needs from which he cannot  unhook himself and they constitute a coercion of his mind in the sole  direction of their satisfaction.<br>
              <br>
              Weak, inside the stiffness of  Matter, earthly man is far from wisdom and the Power since the real Power is  accompanied by knowledge and wisdom; that is why it accompanies those who have  proved they are capable of directing it according to the will of God.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong><em>Not cruelty. But Leniency, Sorrow, Concession,  Kindness (these, of course, prudently, without exaggeration) there is also  Power and wisdom</em>. </strong>            </p>
<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a09"></a>9</strong></span><strong>.<em> Emilyan Monae, the  sovereign from Western Libya, the liar princeling Julian, the liar bishop  Pegasius, Nero, the sophist</em></strong> who is reading  Plato in Salome's palace, lived <strong><em>beneath the lies that covered them </em></strong>for  a long time.&nbsp; We, as human beings rivet  ourselves in fear for a whole life or whole lives and most importantly, the  lack of our becoming conscious pushes us to committing small or big crimes  against ourselves and others. Our ignorance forces us to sin, to fall wide of  the mark, to become &quot;evil&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="../afos/Plato/index_en.htm" class="la">Socrates </a>said that &quot;nobody is evil  of his own free will&quot; meaning that the lack of awareness leads to  Evil:</p>
            <p><strong><em><br>
              The (so called) wicked man hates badness as much as the (so called) good man. Only his appreciation of what is bad is different. He explains his actions to himself and does not consider them bad. At the same time that he is committing a very bad action - a crime - there are many actions (things) which he disapproves and would not do because he considers that they are bad. So, from one point of view, a</em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em>no "bad man" </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em>does not </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> exists. We are all - variously - all, and all want to be, good.<br> 
              </em></strong><br>
              <strong><em>When you feel you are  wicked and it pains you and you have qualms of conscience you are, in reality,  wicked no more because you dislike your actions and they no longer belong to  you. But when you are wicked with no qualms of conscience and you rather enjoy,  then you are wicked unconsciously, so are not wicked at all, for you are not  responsible. Then there exists no wickedness after all? *</em></strong><br>

<p><a name="la_ju_2"></a>The stage of ignorance is  determinism in the process of evolution and nobody can avoid it. For instance,  by the earthly analogy, a man can not come of age if he does not first go  through the stage of childhood. If ignorance does not precede and indeed if  someone does not remain in it as long as it is necessary, he cannot pass to  knowledge.<br>
  <br>
What exists for everyone is only  whatever is contained in his conscience and anything he has not gained yet,  does not exist.<br>
<br>
From the moment we are found  incarnated here, we are all &quot;sick and travellers&quot;, meaning weak and on the way, that is why &quot;we have no  sin&quot;. He, who falls wide of the mark and is not aware of  it, cannot possibly be judged, regardless of the fact that one day he  will seek to invalidate the bad result of  his even non-conscious  inconsiderateness. The notion of sin begins to exist from the moment man acquires  consciousness of the way and his destiny. In order for someone to deviate from  a course, he must have already traced it,  and be travelling it  consciously.  He, who chooses Good consciously, the way of regaining his highest  positive-divine properties, becomes conscious of his inconsiderateness,   knows deep within himself even his potential mistake and automatically enters  the procedure of returning to his target, each time he deviates from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The final Good as a highest target,  which is always One, is none other than &quot;evil&quot;, which our soul transformed into  good with hard work and pain. &quot;Evil&quot;, the absence of positive-divine properties  within ourselves, does not constitute a self-existent condition of the self; besides  we define it, being dependant on good. Evil, for example, is the ignorance of good,  our doubt about good. Evil is the overtaking or the exceeding of good. Evil is  the bad use of good. Evil is the fatigue or the non-endurance of good. Evil is  good that is not ready.<br>
<br>
That is why our retrogressions to  &quot;evil&quot;, the outcome of fear, are inevitable. It is so deeply rooted in the  human soul that we will be defeated time and time again only to rise once more and fight  harder, until we are announced victors of the Light. Let us not forget that even  the Lord struggled with Temptation three times.            </p>
<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a10"></a>10</strong></span><strong>. </strong>In our era conscience has been  focused exclusively on the material aspect of life. 
  Our World is seized by  ignorance &ndash; and ignorance is the &quot;Evil&quot;. It is the era when the Beast reigns, meaning greed, dependence, indifference, heartlessness. And all this is the  lack of the Knowledge of Truth. This Knowledge is so important that it made the First  Created feel like stealing from the Tree of &quot;Knowledge of Good and Evil&quot;,  and afterwards to be punished by being sent away from what they wanted to  steal. Because Knowledge is created, cultivated, and only then can one taste  Its fruits, and not by trying to violently extract something one did not  struggle to cultivate.<br>
  <br>
This is how it happened with the previous Earthly civilization. It, too, was punished by returning to start all over again, in order to be able to become worthy of the Knowledge, and not steal  it; also look at the other myth of Prometheus, who stole Fire from the  Gods, and was punished. Naturally, punishment is none other than the results of  man's action itself, and no God &quot;imposes&quot; it.<br>
<br>
Knowledge is indispensable to man, who does not wish to remain blind. Knowledge is the love for God and whoever is looking for Him must seek it. Because we saw that a man may be absolutely in  harmony with earthly life, may have in fact climbed to the highest earthly  ranks, reading Plato, studying the Scriptures and praying, being &quot;aware&quot; of  everything but yet,  not understanding anything! Unless he starts the real  journey of self-knowledge, the internal work of becoming conscious, so that he  clears his heart from fears and re-unites with Love, he will remain exiled, condemned  in the darkness of matter and external surface.<br>

              Knowledge constitutes the bulwark  of life. There is no way for it to be given to us externally, however, it is  revealed to us each time we look within ourselves. External learning is not  able to lead us to self-realization and  unity. On the contrary,  sometimes it provides us with an alibi to avoid the rugged road of experience. Experience  is stripped of its substance and is substituted by names, definitions, notions, theories, intellectual forms.<br>

              Intellectual ability becomes an  ideal shelter, which substitutes reality. The mind, chiefly in its high achievements, misleads: man considers himself spiritual, without in reality having the  slightest idea what the real Life of the human Spirit is. Our spiritual  thisness, the spirit, is a clearly experiential reality, something very  specific and it has no relation to theoretical elaborations. &nbsp;<br>
              <br>
The  passage from Fear to Love, the purging of the heart of the fears it has been  carrying, is a vast journey of experiences, whose residuum  is instilled within ourselves slowly and gradually. The activation of knowledge is not  the product of mental decision or mental processing, but the product of the  work on the equivalent experiences. <br>
<br>
The young man <strong><em>of twenty three came to read</em>. <em>But after he had only read for ten  minutes, he quit </em></strong>in order to give himself up to daydreaming. <strong><em>To  the erotic warmth that came over his flesh today</em> </strong>&hellip; It is then, however,  that <strong><em>he  totally belongs to the books, </em></strong>because then man draws up the knowledge  from within himself and becomes spiritual: when he lives, when he experiences; not  when he reads. <strong></strong></p>
The activation of the fifth energy centre,   that which radiates and accepts energies of intellectual texture, is just one stage in the course of evolution of the human being and certainly not the final  one. The process of evolution is not completed with the attainment of mental  development, but with the faculty of intuitive conception of the truth, and the  ability to offer love to fellow humans. It is by then that <strong><em>the mind rises to the ideals </em></strong>and  this point is the border, beyond which the philosopher becomes wise and the  scientist an intuitive knower.
<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a11"></a>11</strong></span><strong>. </strong>As conscience lives the big Night of fear for a series of incarnations, man  confuses the notion of faith with <strong><em>re</em></strong><strong><em>verence </em></strong><strong><em>and submission</em></strong>. He considers faith identical to  blind obedience to something, which he places higher than  himself for functional reasons, and  which he hands over to an authority. He is  riveted in this way in doctrines, shapes, systems, and formalities of every  kind, succumbing to the need to suppress his doubts. <br>
  <br>
Through rallying, <strong><em>ridiculous systems both in conception and application</em>,</strong><strong> </strong>like the ones that <strong><em>Julian  seeing negligence </em></strong><strong><em>of</em></strong><strong><em> the </em></strong><strong><em>gods</em></strong><strong>, </strong>tried to organize, for a while man seeks his identity in things  outside himself and considers it natural to <strong><em>be one of the many units, </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> in the great addition that has so  many numbers</em>. </strong></p>
<strong><em>Counted in the  total sum </em></strong>and completely  identified with the partial &ndash; a family, a group, a system, an idea, a theory &ndash;  man will manifest his duality each time, by experiencing repeated intellectual and  emotional polarizations. As long as people remain prey to their  internal polarizations, human groups will disagree, will split,  will be divided constantly and will make war with each other.<br>

              Disagreement  and division are nevertheless an unavoidable way for man, as they derive from the   very duality of his nature. Conflicts, contrary to the instinct that calls people to unite and  co-operate, are the necessary frictions of  matter, the inner processing and  the sorting out of the lower self. The duality that torments the internal world  &ndash; <strong><em>and  my heart &ndash; like a corpse &ndash; is buried</em></strong> &ndash; is necessary to be expressed, to  become known, to be released in order to be transformed into internal unity.  The external schisms, therefore, will be unavoidable as long as the confusion of internal contradictions lasts. Situations like confrontation, dis-agreement, dis-cord, dis-unity, doubt, will accompany  earthly man because they will exist within himself.<br>
              <br>
Patience is needed, self-restraint  and steely power, for real tranquility  to be conquered; besides, the more man  advances, he sees that  exercises become demanding. Even when he  reaches the point of asking himself <strong><em>why should</em></strong> he<em> <strong>have</strong></em><strong> <em>to</em></strong> collide, <strong><em>why should it be demanded he go  and battle miserably</em>,</strong> he will realize that time and experiences are  needed, until the thought <strong><em>the right one had an effect</em></strong>, until  he surpasses polarization and installs internal peace within himself  permanently. Innumerable times he will see his self regressing and submitting: <br>

              In <strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em> great</em></strong><strong><em> addition </em></strong>of generalizations and oversimplifications,  which provides him with a feeling of security and unity, even a false one, man  gathers experiences,  collects material of the soul  in order to work it out later on. Each one of us attracts and is attracted to  the experience which is each time indispensable to him. The structure and the  parameters of every experience, which man himself chooses &ndash; since we ourselves  set the stages which our soul goes through - offer him the perfect  conditions and the perfect opportunity to get to know exactly all that he needs  to know in the path of his evolution, at the specific moment. <br>
              <br>
Interacting with others, man will experientiate the whole  range of emotions, even their finest hues, so as to conquer his emotional  self-sufficiency some day. His intellectual horizon will broaden and his mind  will be sharpened, so that he will manage to grasp the meaning of two  contradictory terms and recognize them as correct. Most important of  all, he will learn to control what incites him each time, and recognize when it  is the voice of his self and when it is fear. In this way, he will come to know  his Self and trust Love. <br>
<br>
That is why the way of disagreement is a deterministic way for man, even in the  highest ranks of evolution. For instance, people like Paul and Barnabas, who walked  on the steps opened for them by Him &ndash; the incarnation of Unity and Love &ndash; after  a long period of comradeship and collaboration, disagreed and went their separate ways. &quot;And the contention was so sharp between them,  that they departed asunder one from the other&quot; (Acts of the Apostles 15:36-41)  for an insignificant cause - the choice of the most appropriate student to  follow them. They parted, even though they had consciousness of their Task and  that is why they aimed at joint efforts and collaboration; not out of mere  instinct, but out of knowledge of how important collaboration of souls here, on  Earth is.<br>
<br>
A reason that entangles us in such situations is the fear that we are being threatened, something that is not  valid, because the courses of peoples' lives are always parallel, therefore no  one is threatened by anyone else. The conflicts are impossible, an imaginary  fear which by itself disorientates the course in the name of some imminent, yet  forever non-existent, conflict. Other people do not act towards us, and we must  not act towards them either. Each one acts only for and towards his self; so we  see how useless and foolish it is to produce any negative feeling towards  others within ourselves. When we comprehend this deeply, then we will get rid of the  fear constantly being caused by our fellow men.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The real conflict is something that  happens esoterically in man and  does not  involve others in essence. When man  finds himself in an inner imbalance, then he directs the waves of his  disturbed energy to the outside, resulting in its appearing in his  immediate environment as tense relationships with the others. That is why the man who  experiences real tranquility does not face disturbances in his relationships  either, even if he associates with persons that provoke him. This man can  accept his fellow human beings exactly as they are, and may also talk with  them, since, being in a higher vibration than them, can hyper-cover them.</p>
            <p>From the depths of the centuries and till their  end, His words are the Word of Peace; and he who recognizes Him, does not know  Confrontation&hellip;
            </p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a12"></a>12</strong></span><strong>. </strong> For as long as man does not work  internally in order to cure his soul of fears, he will mentally recognize<strong><em> the  words of wisdom </em></strong>of Agelaus, of Jesus and of all those who lived <strong><em>teaching  the right things</em></strong>, but this will not be enough to prevent him from all  kinds of conflicts; <strong><em>the City will follow him</em>, <em>he  will roam the same streets and</em></strong> <strong><em>he will</em></strong> <strong><em>always arrive in this city</em></strong>,  as he will continue to experientiate the materialization of his inner  conflicts externally. Because what man deeply desires is to finalize his Faith,  but after he explores it first, tests it and confirms it innumerable times so  as to let his self go freely with It completely, voluntarily and consciously. <br>
  <br>
The farther away man is, the more inaccessible and enigmatic he finds the image of God. Because God works in silence and leaves those traces only, that awaken and stimulate the spirit.  Respect replaces fear, when man reaches the point of forming a system of values  and criterion of evaluation. <br>

              Faith neither aims at blind  obedience to the commands of external circumstances, nor at the withdrawal from the  claim of desires, nor, of course, at an insubstantial groundless optimism. Such  a faith - which does not permit man <strong><em>to violate laws and customs, and leave the  accepted and insufficient straightforwardness</em>, </strong>even<strong> <em>to break the statues of the gods</em></strong> &ndash; is reduced to folly and solace, and draws man away from the Self and the  elevation towards God. What meaning could it have for man <strong><em>to keep the laws and the customs</em></strong>,  not because he really wishes to, but because <strong><em>he is afraid of the destructive act</em>? </strong><br>
              <br>
              On the contrary, the man who has  been awakened becomes conscious of the fact that there does not exist any  &quot;faith&quot; for him, which would anticipate his experience. Then, he ceases <strong><em>to be  counted in the total sum </em></strong>and he devotes himself exclusively to his  internal edifice of faith-knowledge, the only one which can lead him not only to  discover  the real reason why <strong><em>the gods </em></strong><strong><em> died</em></strong>, but the way to  resurrect them within himself as well. His sole guide in his steps and his sole  property is the love of God, as he has known It through his personal path of  initiation.<br>
              <br>
              Then, he turns the focus of his consciousness inwardly in the pursuit and realization of his personal destiny in the specific incarnation, the evolution of his personal truth; his fervent desire  is <strong><em>to  carry his stone to the great edifice of Progress</em></strong>; to find the distinct  life task which he has undertaken &ndash; <strong><em>words, volition or actions </em></strong>&ndash; and  attend to it. Mainly, he ceases to spend his energy with people and activities,  which wear him out. He then starts to use the supreme opportunity, which was  given to him with his human incarnation, in the best way, fulfilling the advice  of the Master in his life:<br>

              He keeps his mouth closed, his mind  open and his powers in vigilance. When the noise silences, when the channels of  talking to people close, he understands better what comes from within himself,  what is always present at a deeper level. </p>

              This Voice leads him to work with  his inner world, <strong><em>his city</em></strong>, so that his course would be smoothed out. For as long as  someone knows his self and the causality of the Universe, he understands that  wherever there is inner setting in order, there the external path is revealed, since  nothing that is happening, is accidental and in vain. If, consequently, he wants <strong><em>to  find new places and other seas</em></strong>, what he ought to do is first  organize his &quot;inside&quot;, because no help is effective if man himself is not ready  for it. One would have noticed in his life that steps always follow  an  effort of his to put things on a correct basis; otherwise <strong><em>every effort is destined to  damnation</em>. &nbsp;</strong><br>
              <br>
              The aim of self-knowledge, as was  already known to our ancient ancestors, was exactly to steer man towards recognizing the &quot;product&quot; of his soul. If our life has a chance to change, if the world has  a chance to change, this is only changing &quot;what comes out&quot; &ndash; to remember   another reference in Jesus' words on the same topic. </p>
