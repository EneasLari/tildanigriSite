Love is not differentiated  from hatred, as far as the general category is concerned, but its opposite,  indifference. To love or to hate are differentiated as to the manifestation,  but have a common basis which places them in the  same  category qualitatively: the intense and fervent occupation with the object.<br>
              <br>
So, denial and affirmation may  basically constitute a like re-action to  something. Different reaction is not constituted in the opposite of each of the  two concepts, but in the lack of re-action. Meaning, whether denial or  affirmation, it essentially remains a reaction, while  refusal is wrongly  regarded as lack of reaction.<br>
<br>
The change of a circumstance happens  not when two different-extreme manifestations of action or emotion  (and their  intermediate of course) alternate, but when this action or emotion is abolished as a general  category. For instance, the man who is experiencing anger and expresses it openly,  just like the man who has denied and repelled it, are in fact on a common level. <br>
<br>
It often happens that someone  wants something and due to some concurring reasons he cannot have it, he then  denies it and &quot;does not want it&quot;. He is still at exactly the same point as before. The situation changes as  long as the &quot;I want&quot; and the &quot;I do not want&quot; cease to be strong within him.  Then he feels that he &quot;neither wants&quot;, &quot;nor does not want&quot;. So more generally,  the delimitation of the being as a being and a non being expands and is  contradistinguished from the absence of the being. </p>
            <p>The being, either as actual being (positive  qualities) or as non-being (negative qualities), falls into the same category.  So, the non-being has an entity and a presence equivalent to the being.<br>

Those who toil and cultivate Knowledge, know that the seed of Good is very powerful, and a drop of Good - or Light, or  Love - may counterbalance an ocean of Evil. Because a molecule of Existence is  infinitely more powerful than an ocean of Non-existence. Life is always  stronger, and after all, this is what led to the beginning of the Eons, the Big Bang as we call it today.</p>
            <p>And all those who side with the Deed of God on Earth, sow the seeds of the New Tree, which is as strong as the Light opposite  the darkness, as  Being opposite the No-thing. </p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a60"></a>61</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Jesus spoke to us of Eternal Life, and promised it to us.</p>
Well, now we can understand it: Eternity is the  transition from the world of polarizations to the world of the One, Unchanging  and Apathetic. Eternal life has nothing  to do with time - after all, our scientists also tell us now that time is something  &quot;artificial&quot; &ndash; and of course it is not placed somewhere  &quot;else&quot;, after death, etc., but belongs to another level of cognition:  it belongs to the space where nothing needs its opposite - or its absence  thereof &ndash; in order to be defined, therefore where the Word does not exist,  because the Word defines in this life, and through this it gives existence. So,  He spoke of Eternal Life, meaning through the &quot;continuous life&quot; the abolition  of death as &quot;absence of life&quot;. He abolished death and showed that the soul can  eventually be reduced to a level where there are no pairs [i.e. Life-death (=  lack, absence  of life)], but the final One. The qualitative change of the /e/ to  /o/ (i.e. the Greek word [On] <em>(in Greek means Being)</em> stemming from the  Greek  word [En] <em>(in Greek means One)</em>  shows precisely the qualitative difference of Polarized and Eternal Life. When the Being <em>(&quot;On&quot;)</em> breaks  away from the conscience of division and duality, it will manage to return to the One <em>(&quot;En&quot;)</em> and  then death will have been abolished as a polar/pair of Life, on the way which  He showed by His descent into Matter.<br>

              The man who &quot;trampled down death&quot;, searches the Universe  to recognize the Lights which delineate His Way.</p>
            <p><a name="la_02"></a>Jesus creates Time and he, who loses himself in His present, discovers the Eternal. The World lives and is completed within us, and within us we will discover the laws that determine the Infinite. If we are seeking Him, let us hear our Voice and believe it, because our Voice is His Voice and our Voice creates as He does. He is born through us every day, because He is the Non-manifested who manifests in the Worlds. If we go beyond the circumstantial and the specific, we will discover  that the manifestations are alternations of the Unchanging, configurations of the Endless.  Whoever does not identify with the partial, discovers eternal tranquility, because he is everything, and while he identifies with the Good, he does not identify with its reversal and does not experience pain. Pain is a sign of the sense of terminality.  The Eternal is expressed through joy and expresses joy, because it knows the  changes, and inside Evil it discerns the arrival of Good. It does not worry inside  Good, because there the universe balances again and again, while it is agitated  by opposing forces, because Good is the Unity of all qualities, Good is the unification  of Good and Evil. One and its absence are included inside the One; the Infinite  and the Void are included inside the Infinite. The paradox is that Creation  creates the Created again; each Birth gives birth to the World again. Beyond the gates of this world, man knows no distinctions  to sub- and ob-jects, because he does not know the dual but the expressed  unity. </p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a61"></a>62</strong></span><strong>. </strong>We see troubled and wretched people  around us. Mental illnesses are exacerbated and consciences dulled; often even His own people surrender to the  powers of darkness, sink into pessimism and forget Him. </p>
The era we live in is a troubled era, because  Humanity is called before its responsibilities, and  before decisive and  critical decisions. The mistakes of the past now erupt all  together, to mobilize a new commencement in Life. Even those who are not  personally responsible for the fate of the world, are called on to encounter it, to  come to know the true face of the situation, as well as to have a foretaste of its  bitter results afterwards.<br>

              Evil, meaning inertia, acts on  the other hand, by lulling consciences to sleep, deactivating the defense mechanisms that Life has instilled in every being as an instinct. Immobility is  the enemy of motion, the cosmic and final death. Whoever defeats inertia sides with Eternal Life, the lust towards which is the Power of Love.            </p>
            <p><a name="la_pl_9"></a>Matter hides great friction within it (as the Science of Physics mentions), capable of immobilizing even the most active movement. Only a constant supply of a driving force anew can defeat friction  and carry on the movement. This force derives from the ethereal plane and is the power of Love. Without it, Life slows down and at some point in time becomes  immobilized. Those were His words when he spoke to the people about Eternal Life,  when he showed them the way to discover it through His own &quot;death&quot;, that  ultimate sacrifice for Love. His &quot;death&quot; then defeated death, defeated the attrition  that leads to Eternal Immobility and marked the way of Resurrection, Restoration to  motion, through feeding anew with the power of Love.<br>

              Once, some people were seeking the &quot;magic filter of Immortality&quot;:&nbsp; we,  however, know that for he who feels his heart alive, there is no death, even in  natural death. He, who offers his earthly life as a sacrifice on the altar of  Love for something - hence of Love for Life itself - has discovered the secret  of Immortality.</p>
The aeon of Life is His path, which passes through  the time-less. As long as our thought accompanies Him, everything will be  familiar and close to us. Light and Darkness is the same Being, is the heart that  moves in the Perpetual Universe.<br>

            <p>The person, who knows the  abolition of death, walks the path of liberation in this life, that will enable  him to relinquish the lower bodies. The One and Only calls him <em><strong>in undivided love</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em>in the path of  Unity, <strong><em>unto the</em></strong> <em><strong>great Nothing returned from life</strong>,</em> where there is no sorrow,  anguish, pain. <br>
                <br>
                This is what <em><strong>a man from Samos</strong>, </em>who now <em><strong>lies  by the Ganges</strong></em>, experienced. <em><strong>On this thrice-barbarous earth, he  lived a life of pain, toil and lamentation. </strong></em>He was deprived of  what he loved most in life: <em><strong>deprived of a Grecian voice, and far from the shores of Samos</strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em>Since <em><strong>he wore himself  out until old age </strong></em><em>and<strong> laboured breathlessly, </strong></em>he himself became an example <strong><em>of his daring and skilful endeavour</em></strong><strong>.</strong> <em><strong>Now, therefore,</strong></em> he says, <em><strong>I suffer nothing horrible, and I'm not heading, mourningful,  towards Hades. </strong></em>And what he was  deprived of -<em><strong> </strong></em><em><strong>a Grecian voice</strong></em> - he will acquire: <strong><em>from now on I shall speak Greek.</em></strong><br>
                <br>
  Let us not worry, then, when we are in pain; we should then be happy, because Life flows in our veins. Let us not worry when we are wounded by Love; we should then calm down, because we defeat immobilization. Let us not worry when we are anxious about the Truth and  the Lie; we should then believe that we are walking together with Eternity.<br>
  <br>
  We should only feel sorry for  the people whose immune system has been infected with heartlesness; because to them  death is simply a matter of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Once we are freed from matter,  we will not need so much effort any more to feed motion, the vibration of the  soul. Then we will feel true freedom, true tranquility, as if we had been  carrying a cross uphill that leads to death, and were rid of it... </p>
            Fear does not touch the souls that have   identified with the Truth, because it does not belong in their dimension. They  tread in the footsteps that have been opened up to them, without fear, because  there is no beginning or end. Death is life; space is the moment.

              When, after accumulated  experience and knowledge of countless previous incarnations, the earthy man Gautama Sindarta is spiritually awakened and becomes a Buddha, he cries out: &quot;I  run through the cycle of many incarnations, seeking the architect. It is tough to  be born so many times. Architect, I finally met you. You will never build this  house again.&quot; (Tibetan Book of the Dead) </p>
            <p><a name="la_ty_5"></a>But also, one of the strongest  texts of the ancient Greek spirit, is a letter sent by <a href="../afos/Apolonios/index_en.htm" class="la">Apollonius of Tyana</a> to  emperor Valerius, when the latter lost his son: <br>
  <br>
&quot;There is no death of anyone, but only in  appearance, even as there is no birth of any, save only in seeming. The change  from being to becoming seems to be birth, and the change from becoming to being  seems to be death, but in reality no one is ever born, nor does one ever die.  It is simply a being visible and then invisible; the former through the density  of matter, and the latter because of the subtlety of being &ndash; being which is  ever the same, its only change being motion and rest.
For being has this necessary peculiarity that its  change is brought about by nothing external to itself, but whole becomes parts  and parts become whole in the oneness of the all. And if it be asked: What is  this which sometimes is seen and sometimes not seen, sometimes in the same form and at other times in another? &ndash; it might be answered: It is the way of everything here in the  world below that when it is filled out with matter it is visible, owing to the  resistance of its density, but is invisible, owing to its subtlety, when it is  rid of matter, though matter still surrounds it and flows through it in that  immensity of space which hems it in but knows no birth or death.<br>
<br>
But why has this false notion [of birth and death] remained so long without a refutation? Some think that what has happened  through them, they have themselves brought about. They are ignorant that the  individual is brought to birth <em>through</em> parents, not by parents, just as a thing produced <em>through</em> the earth is not produced <em>from</em> it. The change which comes to the individual is nothing that  is caused by his visible surroundings, but rather a change in the one thing  which is in every individual.<br>
<br>
And what other name can we give to it but primal  being? Tis it alone that acts and suffers becoming all for all through all,  eternal deity, deprived and wronged of its own self by names and forms. But  this is a less serious thing than that a man should be bewailed, when he has  passed from man to God by change of state and not by the destruction of his  nature. The fact is that  far from mourning death, you ought to honour it and  revere it. The best and the fittest way for you to honour death is now to  leave the one who's gone to God, and set to work to play the ruler over those  left in your charge as you were wont to do. It would be disgrace for such a man  as you to owe your cure to time and not to reason, for time makes even common  people cease from grief.<br>
<br>
The greatest thing is a strong rule, and of the  greatest rulers he is best who first can rule himself. And how is it permissible to wish to change what has been brought to pass by will of God? If  there's a law in things, and there <em>is</em> one, and it is God who has appointed it, the righteous man will have no wish  (desire) to try to change good things, for such a wish is selfishness, and  counter to the law, but he will think that all that comes to pass is a good  thing. On! heal yourself, give justice to the wretched and console them; so  shall you dry your tears.<br>
<br>
You should not set your private woes above your public  cares, but rather set your public cares before your private woes. And see as well what consolation you already have! The nation sorrows with you for your  son. Make some return to those who weep with you; and this you will more  quickly do if you will cease from tears than if you still persist. Have you not  friends? Why! you have yet another son. Have you not even still the one that's  gone? You have! &ndash; will answer anyone who really thinks. For &quot;that which is&quot;  doth cease not &ndash; nay <em>is</em> just for the  fact that it will be for aye; or else the &quot;is not&quot; is, and how could that be  when the &quot;is&quot; doth never cease to be?<br>
<br>
Again it will be said you fail in piety to God and  are unjust. Tis true. You fail in piety to God, you fail in justice to your  boy; nay more, you fail in piety to him as well. Would'st know what death is?  Then make me dead and send me off to company with death, and if you will not  change the dress you've put on it, you will have straightway made me better  than yourself.&quot;<br>

God  expressed Himself through Creation. He created the Universe World, because He,  Himself, existed in Eternity, and set the Beginning of Motions, because He, Himself  existed in its arsis. God existed through His  Creation, namely He formed His Self, reflected His Self inside it. So, the  Absolute was configured in the Partial, the Timeless in the one Subjected to the  dimension of Time, the Infinite in the one Subjected to the dimension of Space.  Through Creation, God defined a Face for His Self  with specific manifestations each moment. The One became the Infinite in the  sense of multiplicity. The will of God for Self-determination bore the  specification of each and every potentiality into a form, made every thought visible through  potentiality in this direction. </p>
            <p>So the Universe composed the Face of God, in which  the Creator crystallized His Identity and defined the concept of His Existence.  The Universe, being a partial subtotal of the Being, may change indefinitely, take  on countless forms, but it can never take the totality of the One, because it  was created exactly in order to &quot;split&quot; this totality and express its infinite,  partial potentialities. While, therefore, it constitutes the potential One, it  cannot actually reach it, because the subtotal can never identify with the total.  In other words, this describes what we have also mentioned earlier, namely that  man - as essence of God - cannot experience the composition of the partials  except only mentally, cannot understand in practice the concentration of  opposites at the same point, as for example, the gender-lessness of the angels,  namely the unification of the masculine and the feminine into a  &quot;denser&quot; element (and here we remind you of the respective unification  of colours into white).

                  <p>Man is that  link which connects the world of the intangible with the world of matter. He is  that One from which the two worlds start and expand towards infinity, and therein  he is the <em>image</em> of God, since he  himself (man) too, like Him (God) is the One, the beginning, the hyper-dense moment  of potentiality. Therefore man is <em>perfect</em>,  since he has the same identity as God, and this life gives him the opportunity  to manifest into matter and then transmute matter into immaterial energy,  namely to co-unite the two worlds, as a bridge where the elements of these worlds  consciously co-function.</p>

            <p>So, true  Faith is <em>self-knowledge</em>; the  distinction of the being from the process of its self-realization. In other words, the belief of not identifying with the flow, but the uplifting of the Self above the flow (motion) to the point of the eternal and unchangeable <em>being</em>. When man feels this situation, then before his &quot;eyes&quot; all the trials of life are  transformed into variations of the same substance. Through these &ndash; through all the repetitive <strong><em>Alexandrias</em></strong> which he has experienced  and <strong><em>bid  farewell</em></strong> - he redefines His Self  and identifies it with the Eternal and Timeless and Apathetic and Unchangeable. Even the removal of existence &ndash; <strong><em>the  great No</em></strong> - eventually leads to the one and only category of the One Being - because it is defined through Its opposite  also, as for example, Matter and Anti-Matter finally define Hyper-matter.<br>
              <br>
True Faith is the  awareness of  actually being.<br>

              Earthly life has  much joy to offer the man who knows the abolition of death. He will seek his  happiness in counterbalance; he will love the world he created within himself - <strong><em>as he himself judges them, </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> wanted them, sees them as beautiful; not as he saw them </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> in nature or studied  them </em></strong>- as God loved the world He created within Him. He  does what he must, suffice he knows that this is what appears to be and not  what exists. He is not in a hurry to face what exists, because the gaze  frightens the unruly animal and puts it to flight. He waits and loves, because  his Task is a life task for some people who remember death only. He has the  time before him for everything to be fulfilled on time. After all, life is  beautiful for him now. He lives it without thinking, without anguish and  concern. He knows its cycles and he waits for them without fear. He is loyal to  his heart and strict with his fears. </p>
He activates his  decisions, always considering causality, i.e. the earthly time required  for the materialization of every energy change and he trusts his Self, which is  his Soul inside the Soul of the World, meaning God. Reality reigns inside his  Imagination, Light lives in his eyes. There is no lie, because the soul that  lives within the Light attracts images from the Light. So he trusts what he  foresees and moves towards the place his heart considers its homeland. There,  fear and insecurity have no place, because there, Love is rewarded with Love  and Darkness is rewarded with Light.<br>

��&nbsp;Even God Himself, the  Being of the beings, chose Life  for His self-realization. The Creator himself permeated his Creation to re-cognize  himself. Our life is the confirmation of Life. Whatever it brings before us is  what will remind us of the truth and the path of the return to <em>Being</em>. That is why we should not  identify with <em>Having,</em> because having  is the means through which <em>being</em> is  realized. </div></td>
