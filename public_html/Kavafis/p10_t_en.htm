              The  signs come to ensure the correct orientation for people, when the darkness of the night  has covered the sun of inner will. As long as this sun shines, then everything  is clear and transparent and man can choose his way without doubt, according to  the desire of his conscience. But there are moments when conscience sinks into  the night, the road is covered by opacity and then man calls his higher self, who has the capability of wider vision, to guide him in order to avoid the reefs. The answer of the higher conscience which is attuned to the Harmony of the  Universe is expressed with coincidences and phenomena of the Universe and is  interpreted by the conscience with a specific meaning. In reality then, the soul  has been connected to the higher level of Harmony and has restored the  cooperation with the rhythms of the World &ndash; that is why the signs are always  external phenomena of the conscience, meaning expressions of the (external) World. The  signs do not substitute choice because something like that would refute the law  of free will and desire which moves the thread of man's life. Signs simply  connect man with his prior decision, reveal in front of him again his  pre-existing desire, harmonize him with the higher vibrations of his very  self. In reality, they are his own decisions and not some invisible cooperation  of the environment, which did not take him into consideration or decided  on his behalf.<br>
              <br>
Signs  are phenomena of the external environment that man chooses to notice after  internal and invisible prompting of his (higher) self &ndash; like a ring which we  put on in order to remind us of something.<br>
<br>
Dreams  are also signs that our self projects before our eyes, as long as   conscience is set free from the influence of the mind. The  interference of the intellect hinders the reception of messages sent by other people  or by our own self; these messages remain re-deciphered in the subconscious  until they find a proper time to appear. The proper time is sleep, when  conscience is harmonized with its Source and the mind silences. Then  all the messengers who waited in the waiting room of our soul appear, in order  to announce the cosmic messages to us. <br>
<br>
So,  let us not confuse dreams with the future. Future is a chain of choices which  constantly open new roads, which man can follow. We can see the future as a  present that has already begun, as a path which since we started it, will lead  us to a specific destination. Human souls usually have the tendency to  complete the courses they choose. That is why the future is &quot;anticipated&quot; as the natural continuation of the start that has been made. But  we should not face this  as a coercive commitment to a future predestined by someone else; it is the  course, which the soul chooses for its self, that passes through specific roads.  It is just that each road has  a known and predetermined direction and if you choose it  you will pass through the stop off points predetermined for this road. Naturally,  there is always the possibility of returning before the end of the road and this  makes the road something not definitively predictable.<br>
<br>
Man must live each moment without  censoring his spontaneous instinct and without rationalizing his feelings, so  that he does not miss the signs; he should work without distractions of the  mind and emotions, without wasting time in doubt and judgment. </p>
            <p><strong><em>And the more </em></strong>the  soul <strong><em>advances,  the more searching</em>, <em>more attentive it  must be</em></strong>; when people are focused exclusively on the external world, it  is inevitable to miss <strong><em>the messages</em></strong> or to misinterpret  them. <strong><em>Out in the street, the people hear nothing at all</em></strong><em>;</em> consequently <strong><em>the catastrophe carries them away </em></strong>and things are<em> <strong>Finished</strong></em><strong> </strong>for them.

              Just like another <strong><em>hasty  and inexperienced creature</em></strong><em>,</em> Caesar, instead of <strong><em>the understanding of the vanity  of grandeur</em></strong><em>,</em> chose <strong><em>arrogance and intoxication. </em></strong>In that  way he himself also<strong><em> interrupted</em></strong> <strong><em>the work of gods</em></strong>, indeed by interrupting  the very completion of his earthly life cycle. </p>
As it happened with Artemidorus and Julius Caesar,  people often appear in a specific moment of our life, in order to warn us or  give a solution to basic problems of ours. Let us pay attention to the elements  they bring us, let us focus on their words in order to understand which  solution they are giving us. The universal truths they are bringing, are simply  announced by their own voice. If we pass them by, their capability to help will  be lost.
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a34"></a>34</strong></span><strong>. </strong> Even though <strong><em>people know the actual events</em></strong>,  they have never ceased asking to know the future. No <strong><em>god,  full and sole possessor of all lights </em></strong>can possibly  foretell the  &quot;future&quot; of a situation, despite the fact that he may &quot;see&quot; it in advance. This  happens because every person ought to shoulder both the burden of a choice as  well as its responsibility right away. This responsibility of each person for  his own future also includes the capability to change his course even up until  the last minute. The &quot;future&quot;, as visualized by the Master or the guide, is not  final, it is always reversible, consequently nobody else except the person  himself can foresee it.<br>

              The <strong><em>rival Ptolemaic kings</em></strong> ask  for the divination of the oracle at <strong><em>Delphi</em></strong> about who is going to rule,  and while the priests have prepared the answer, at the same time they ignore  that life has already given its answer &ndash; <strong><em>the oracle was pronounced in Rome; there, the  deal was effected. </em></strong>One of them, Evergetis, had been restored by the  Romans, yet the<strong> </strong>priests ignored it &hellip;<br>
              <br>
              But <strong><em>king Manuel Comnenus</em></strong> as  well <strong><em>felt  death was near</em></strong>, and he was right as it was proven, however <strong><em>the  court astrologers (the paid ones) babbled </em></strong><em>/ </em><strong><em>that he had many more years to live</em>. </strong></p>
            <p>The stars hide the keys of Wisdom, for whoever is  capable and ready to conquer it. The means brings the help we expect, only if  it is used correctly. The stars are companions of the souls on the way of the  light; the souls travel through the spectrum of the stars. Small is our  knowledge of the miracle of the universe. No one can possess whatever he has  not earned. No one can know whatever he has not learned from the Masters of the  Brotherhood of the Universe. No one can foretell whatever has not happened.<br>

              The truth is found within ourselves, and  guides us steadily to the light, even when we do not realize it. Our soul knows  its way and follows it like a boat on calm waters. The sails which will propel  us is the power we have within ourselves; suffice we keep silent in order to find  answers in God's words, and not in people's. The way of the soul is the only  truth.<br>
              <br>
Let us not ask, therefore, to know  the future. We are neither going to find it anywhere, nor learn it from anyone  of this or of the invisible life, because this must not happen. Future is not  something that preexists in a specific form and nobody, as we said, can foresee  it. But even if it were possible, what difference does it make? Even when  someone knows the future, this cannot make him act correctly in the present. It  is indeed even more difficult to manage to escape from the coercion of the preset  thinking by knowing the result in advance. The Law of the Unknown Future is one  more benefaction of Providence  in order to facilitate our course.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

              There is no &quot;magical&quot; power  whatsoever, that regulates man's course: everything is  simple and natural and  starts inwardly.

              This is the way of the heart and  this way is marked by the moment. Consequently, everything is predetermined,  because the heart knows in advance, yet this is not manifested. The  manifestation occurs during that very moment when reality, the events touch the  heart momentarily, instantaneously, and then what was long-standing  dormant, appears. It is like a chemical reaction, which happens momentarily and it  is exactly there where the <em>New</em> is  born, the new Truth.<br>
              <br>
From that point onwards, the mind  comes to elaborate the new &quot;product&quot;,  analyze it,  sort it out, but this  process is not creative, it does not give birth, hence it is not decisive for  man's course &ndash; no matter how much  he  considers  his choices  the product of  thought. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The only generative power is the  heart because it is still united with the Essence of the universe, while the  mind can only comment, indulge, or sometimes complicate the Truth. In this  sense, everything is predetermined and predestined, because what the heart  recognizes each time is only one.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>The artistic impressions  sometimes lay unused for a long time, produce other thoughts, are remoulded by  new influences, and when they are crystallized in written words, it is not easy  to remember the time of the first incentive, from where the written words truly  derive.</em></strong></p>
            <p><br>
              Besides, the meaning of this life is  to re-understand what we already know &ndash; and appears as &quot;instinct&quot;. That is why,  for that matter, we are called to follow our instinct, exactly because it  orientates us to the already existing one in the conscience, that one which  we are called to &quot;re&quot;-discover.</p>
Let us ask, therefore, from our self to &quot;see&quot; and  feel what it desires, and let us believe that this is none other than the past,  since it lived in our conscience.

              The connection with the &quot;wider&quot;  conscience-wise self,   gives the correct sense for the truth, by way of  &quot;instinct&quot; or &quot;intuition&quot;, meaning with a code inexplicable to man.  Yet, this sense  is  the right direction, because it carries messages  from the wider conscience.<br>
              <br>
              <em>Miracles</em> can be, in corresponding cases,  firstly the capacity for the conception of the oncoming, through the connection with the  higher self, who has a complete overview of time-space, and after that,  intervention in the powers which act in the present and the change of their course, together  with acceleration of earthly time. <br>
              <br>
Any interference in earthly matters  must be carried out only with divine command, which means resignation of the  human personality and individuality in the specific moment, and man's  transubstantiation into a pure channel of the divine Power. The distortion of  time-space co-ordinates is a task of utmost responsibility, and precisely for  this reason man must withdraw every selfish motive which can set similar  procedures into motion.<br>
<br>
Man can reach the conscious  transmission of energy up  to the sixth centre, since the seventh &ndash; the one that connects him with the  divine thisness and through which he receives the universal vibrations and  unites with his higher self &ndash; presupposes the non-existence of the material body. <br>

<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a36"></a>36</strong></span><strong>. </strong>The man who is committed to the  Hierarchy's Deed on Earth, knows his task since the time he remembers himself, <strong><em>because</em></strong> <strong><em>memory</em></strong> <strong><em>lies  far</em></strong><em>, <strong>in his first adolescent years. </strong></em>Indeed, if he looks back to his  adolescence, he will see that everything was already known to him, of course on  an un-conscious level. &nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  What we consider a course of  the mind towards the future is nothing but a reconnection with the past,  because there lie the seeds of the way that is being unfolded ahead; there, in  the past, the way was chosen, and he who foresees the future is none other than  he who has connected with the past. <br>

  The Poet himself said six months  before his dematerialization: <strong><em>I still have to write twenty five poems.  Twenty five poems!</em></strong> Indeed, he left thirty poems, with which he  completed the internal cycle of his Deed and his destiny on earth. We also saw <strong><em>king  Manuel Comnenus</em>,</strong> who <strong><em>felt death was near</em>,</strong> since he knew  that he had completed his purpose and the moment had come for him to leave the  earthly dimension.</p>

              God's Workers run difficult life  programs: they have been led to the path of offering and their training ought to  be  equivalent. Their trials are mental and emotional so that they are later  able to guide by possessing real knowledge and not just learning. They are  especially sensitive in order to receive experiences in their depth, and they are  subjected to extreme situations so that they are enriched later with a wide range  of events.<br>

              The Worker must give identity to  the Deed, and not the Deed to the Worker. Because only then can man's  personality infuse breath into the creation, when man exceeds the  edifice. Likewise in God's Deed, workers must strengthen and entrench  themselves, so as to be worthy of the earthly battle.<br>
              <br>
We often wonder why we go through  so many difficulties, while we already feel ready to start our creative work.  The answer is that the psychological power that is demanded as a commitment to the  Deed of God is great and he who works must be secured from dangers. That is why  the trials are many and constant, so that his strengthening be assured.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the motives should have been  checked: accepted to the Deed of God is he who desires to lay down his Self to  it, something that certainly presupposes having encountered it, and not the one who is  seeking his identity in things outside himself. The second one, consequently,  is firstly called on to delimitate  and become conscious of himself, and when this is  completed, then he is judged capable of undertaking some duties. It goes  without saying that during this interim of his internal work he has been  welcomed to the bosom of God's beloved, and receives help for this work.  But he should not ask to work externally if he has not first completed it.

              The true Warriors of the Love of  God will not turn around &ndash; <strong><em>they do not notice these things</em>. </strong>They wait until the road in front of them  which will denote the real Mission,  becomes clear. Until then, their heart will constitute the beacon which will  clear the darkness of the unknown, the road sign that will guide the footsteps in  the desert. They do not need to try to foresee or provide for their future,  because the divine Thought is making provision for it. Their own work is to follow in the steps, which are revealed in front of them, and feel the certainty of divine  Grace. Their life does not have choices, because  their choice is final from now on. Therefore, there are no questions any more,  but only on the surface, while deep down the answer pre-exists. </p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a37"></a>37</strong></span>. The internal function that is  taking place within the man who <strong><em>waits for the barbarians</em></strong> - the  certainty of their arrival, the preparations for their welcoming, <strong><em>this  commotion and confusion which begins right away</em></strong><em>,</em> that is brought about by  the imminent event, followed by its denial and, finally, the embarrassment, even  the disappointment that derives from the non materialization of the negative(!)  expectation &ndash; is none other than our fear's projection mechanism, which is fear  of the unknown and creation of a negative image for the future. When we  understand this mechanism, we will dispense with the feeling of fear once and for  all.<br>
  <br>
Be careful, then, with <em>self-fulfilling prophecies!</em> It is known  to almost everyone that a so called &quot;prophecy&quot; which is heard from the mouth of  someone with great self-confidence, can take dimensions of actuality, and this happens,  certainly not because it was meant to be materialized, but because those  believing in it installed it. An announcement about the <strong><em>arrival</em></strong> of some <strong><em>barbarians</em></strong>,  is enough for us to start <strong><em>waiting for them</em></strong>.<br>
<br>
But also in everyday life, people  often move towards these kinds of &quot;prophecies&quot;, which naturally they themselves bring  upon their lives. Just as it is not at all &quot;metaphysical&quot;  to think  of someone who chooses a road and follows it, and all the distinguishing marks of  this road appear afterwards on his course, it is just as simple  to also think of someone who has chosen a mental road, and afterwards he  distinguishes its characteristics while he is walking on it.<br>
<br>
When we try to give answers for what we have &quot;pre-decided&quot;, then we simply recycle what exists within ourselves, by  choosing to &quot;see&quot; external signs which correspond to it. This is the case where  the signs do not show us God's way but they return us to our self. It is very important for someone not to seek signs, when his fears &ndash; or his hyper-optimism, or any other emotion &ndash; are present, because  the  environment will simply reflect these very signs, so that  man will return to the same starting point instead of taking a step forward.<br>
<br>
So when someone is looking for  &quot;signs&quot;, let him first consider whether he is simply interpreting as &quot;signs&quot;,  the distinguishing marks of the road he has internally chosen and on which he  has already started to walk. Of course, this is not reprehensible : on the  contrary it expresses precisely man's free will, and advocates for it, through  the fact that nobody decides for anyone else, nor do they even indicate someone  else's choice. (Because even the indication in many cases reduces the absolute  freedom of choice).<br>
<br>
Just think that if an absolutely  law-abiding and obedient man constantly kept on finding &quot;signs&quot; from above in  his life, every time he had queries on the course, he would be finally  sentenced to never knowing his self, therefore he would stay away from God for  ever! How miserable is he who has always done &quot;what has to be done&quot;, but has  lost his self! <br>
<br>
Signs, therefore, are none other than  road signs on a marked path, on which we are already walking. For as long as we observe  them, we recognize our choice in a certain direction, because often  people proceed along roads and instead of looking, shut their eyes and walk as  if they were blind. Then again at other times, they do not choose a way on  their own impulse, but according to others' desires. So, the signs come again  and again in order to remind them of reality.<br>
<br>
The prophecy  which people's  minds creates, is different from God's prophecy. People's prophecy runs on the axis of  their nature, which is bipolarity, separativeness: it determines roads that  diverge, starting from the same point, like rays extending to the infinite,  without ever meeting. They are, therefore, &quot;compulsory&quot; roads that lead to division. On the contrary, God's prophecy is a road of convergence  that leads to the unbreakable One, from whichever point one may start. If we  contemplate that even Time does not move linearly, we will see that God's  prophecy on the Time axis finally leads to the removal of the polarization and  the abolishment of the dissipation, meaning to the condensing. In that way it  could never be a prophecy that passes through compulsory roads or given actualities.  On the contrary, it leads to the same point, even if the roads in between are  endless. Let us imagine a point on the map, to which one may be led, following  theoretically infinite courses.<br>
<br>
We do not need to concern ourselves,  therefore, with prophecies that people fabricate, mainly out of anguish to  surmount their alarming thought  of infinite choices, which God grants  people. All along, the infinite scared men of the finite dimensions of earthly  life, and that is why they often tried to give shape to it: so the infinite of  Time acquired shape, which, though, in reality it does not have.<br> 
</p>
<p><strong><em>When we say </em></strong><em>&quot;</em><strong><em>Time</em></strong><em>&quot;</em><strong><em> we mean  our self. Most abstract notions simply are our pseudonyms. Time is us.</em></strong></p>
<p><br>
  Let us choose  the way of God. There, we  will discover that there is no need to delimitate  the infinite, the eternal,  the unchangeable One. Let us also think that in practical life,   self-fulfilling prophecies must be replaced by conscious choices of life  courses, which conduce to self-knowledge and do not make it fall asleep. Besides,   the Deed of God on Earth is based exactly on these principles.</p>
True faith does not exist beforehand, it does not  predetermine decisions, because predestined decisions do not leave room for the  heart to come forth, to move towards its desires, to walk on its way. The  man who believes in a self-fulfilling prophecy &ndash; usually negative, that <strong><em>the  barbarians will arrive</em></strong> &ndash; and after that  waits with the certainty  that this will happen,  is alienated from his heart's voice and loses  track  of the Self and of God. True faith leads exactly to this voice, and leaves the  horizon clear and boundless in front of our eyes. It has neither specific ways,  nor compulsory steps. But it knows that whoever moves towards his self, he does  not know fear, because regardless of  the course, the destination is  secured. And when the mind intellectually touches this destination, the soul  feels the calmness and tranquility of Paradise.  Paradise is the symbol of  man's identification with the Self, the first symbolic picture of the One, the coexistence of the  outside and the inside. </div></td>
