              During these moments of the <strong><em>accidental  magnetic neighbourliness</em></strong>, man is being hyper-covered, without his  knowing it, by universal forces of the ethereal world; time, space and natural  laws are by-passed. This <strong><em>spark, the unprovoked joy</em></strong> signals  the first awakening, the awakening of real faith: man recognizes the existence  of a world within himself that is not tangible and accessible to his senses and  knowledge.<br>
              <br>
He then ceases to seek the meaning  of Life in the visible and tangible, but in the invisible and immaterial, with  faith that this will be revealed to those who seek it.<br>

              He starts seeking the repetition of  this state of being, his conscious participation in this hyper-coverage. That  is why he works within himself, sinking the blockage of the intellectual body.  The <em>&quot;</em><strong><em>poet</em></strong><em>&quot; </em>has a <strong><em>sharper gaze </em></strong>because he has managed to control the mind and  thoughts, meaning to discipline the images of his mind from being  directed to where he does not desire. So, he connects with himself and seeks  silence because he knows that it is what will guide him to the Source.<br>

We dull it by association, absence of  thinking, and pleasure. That is why they also see what we cannot. When someone  is alone in a quiet room, he clearly listens to the clock's ticking. But if  others enter and  talk and movement starts, one stops hearing it. But the  ticking does not stop being accessible to hearing.&quot;&nbsp; </em></strong></p>

              The call of the soul to the path of  Knowledge is so strong that Lucian had a dream about the Goddess Paedia  (Learning) urging him to turn to the source of his existence, to seek knowledge  within himself. &quot;I will give you such traits, so that each one seeing you will  nudge the person next to him pointing a finger at you and saying &quot;He is the  man&quot;. <br>

              Faith is not a matter of thought;  it is built little by little with deeds and not rational decisions and sequences. When we  renounce the earthly desire of the mind, when we achieve putting the mind aside  and function with the light of the soul as a guide, and only when we decide to  break free of the weight we have been bearing, shall we understand what we had  refused to accept.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              We will then have stood upon the <strong><em>First  Step</em></strong>, the one that will lead us to the final liberation from the  lower-material worlds.</p>

              The <em>&quot;</em><strong><em>unknown poet</em></strong><em>&quot; </em>becomes optimistic. God's way always  leads to the Light, there is no going back. The river always flows towards the  ocean, so he is certain that the Ocean   of God's Love is his  direction. He enjoys the present with the certainty of an even better future.  Threats, fear, punishments are not for him any more. Whoever knows the  Wonderful and the Eternal so well, can do nothing but depict it in every image  of his eyes and every thought of his mind. Love is catalytic for any &quot;disaster&quot;  or &quot;misfortune&quot;. Whoever saw once, can never close his eyes ever again, because  Light is the End and the Beginning, the Eternal and the Present, the Existence.<br>

              Life in nature &quot;strips&quot;  man of the clothing of pretences, reconnects him with the source of living  energy and clears the energy centres. This, of course, happens when man visits nature with full consciousness and ready to get rid of the layers  of impure energy, which he has absorbed by living in the overpopulated and  noisy cities.<br>
              <br>
Silence, on the other hand, helps  the rhythm of the mind re-coordinate with the pulse of the universe and  reconnect with the ethereal world. The breath of Nature oxygenates the blood  circulation system and restores every kind of disorder of the nervous system.  Colours fill the brain with images, which tame imagination and lead to the path  of the real and eternal Life.<br>

Let us not associate nature with those, whom  theirs it is  not but are simple visitors. Nature to us is a necessary road. Our heart must  silence and submit, because divine orders are stronger than the dictates of  earthly experience.

              The road of life is a dark road;  every step is a victory, and it means shining further  ahead for others to  also step. Spiritual man does not refuse to stand on the way as a watchful  guard, as much as it may seem that nobody is approaching; because light shines far  at  night and bright souls are discernable even by those who are very far away from them in the  course of evolution. &quot;You are the light of the world; a city that is set on a  hill cannot be hid&quot; (Matthew 5:14).</p>
            <p>Let us seek the other beings that live in Nature, and call on them to join forces with us in the good. Let us talk to the beings of the plants and trees, of the animals and  birds, because in this way we illuminate their path as well; the role of teaching is of utmost significance: suffice we speak the language of the weaker, of the powerless, of the one who ignores. The weight falls twice as heavy on those who know the Truth, because they shoulder the responsibility of the "disciples" together with the responsibility of their self, and are called upon to solve twice as many problems, to struggle on many levels. Yet, how important and how wonderful  their task is!...<br>

  The man who possesses knowledge,  teaches it afterwards, with the example of his own life, just like <strong><em>Herod  of Attica</em></strong>. He does not need arguments in order to persuade, he persuades with his very existence. He constitutes a beam of  light in the river which we people form. The energy he diffuses is alive for  our own pores; the concentration of our energies brings only light. He constitutes  a source of life for himself and those around him. His way, which is lit by he  himself, becomes an accumulator of universal love.<br>

              Whoever has reached the point, like  the <strong><em>refined  Herod</em></strong>, of being recognized by his fellow humans as <strong><em>He is the Man</em></strong>, allows  others to gather around him without exercising any kind of pressure or  influence. Convergence occurs following a divine commandment and his call is  not necessary. <br>
              <br>
People's fate is often in the hands  of fellow humans. It is more difficult for Masters to approach people who have  their receptors detuned from the divine Frequency. Then the seniority of their  enlightened fellow humans is particularly important and necessary, until they  open their own channels and from then on become able  to communicate directly  with the Universal Power. <br>
<br>
Only one way exists, and this is  opened only to the eyes of those who desire the Good and love Light and Purity. But what  is now the point of the issue is Ethics, as we also call it, i.e. the  way of life that emanates from the understanding and the implementation of the  Laws of Love in our everyday life. The moral deed is the most important and  foremost one, and we ought to give it precedence over any  attachment, security or other kind of benefit whatsoever.<br>
<br>
In this way, we permanently install  this situation of continuous connection with the Source in our life, whatever  our conscious might be occupied with. We materialize the words of the son of  the <strong><em>priest</em></strong> <strong><em>of</em></strong> <strong><em>Serapeum </em></strong>and we live &quot;praying without ceasing&quot; (A' letter of Paul to the  Thessalonians, 5 / 17):<br>

            <p>It is of no importance if we  believe in typology; what is important is to discover the Essence inside silence  and beyond any mental edifice; to seek Joy within mental tranquility, which  accompanies the connection of the conscience with the Universe. His Presence  will persuade us that silence is as eloquent as the Word. Because the Word is  beyond words and shapes, it is expressed or  unexpressed, yet it is Living and  Life-giving.<br>
