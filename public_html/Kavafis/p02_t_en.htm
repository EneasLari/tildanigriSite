              The human mind does not conceive  time in its correct dimensions and distorts it by projecting attempered  dimensions in a limited time-space instant. The more consciousness grows, man  can expand the perception of time-space, and then he can oversee what the  earthly man is not capable of understanding, because the mind, like the senses,  functions within certain natural limits, beyond which,  for it, there is only void.<br>
              <br>
              As long as man counts exclusively on the <strong><em> Intellect</em></strong>, he is condemned to live in Fear &ndash; material time &ndash;,  separated from his self, sometimes living in <strong><em>yesterday</em></strong> and at others  in <strong><em>tomorrow</em></strong>.<br>

              Man lives united with (his) Self  when he lives in the <em>present</em> -  besides, <strong><em>men know the actual events</em></strong>. The <em>moment</em> is the absence of a specific timetable and must be  experienced self-sufficiently. Fear is wiped out only when man becomes  conscious of the fact that  the quintessence of life, the  concentration of his whole existence is the Now and learns to live every moment  as if it were eternity. <br>
              <br>
Fear is the law of Matter, its  inner existence, the power that preserves it. Basic characteristics of matter  are contraction, cooling and immobilization. In the spiritual plane, in the  consciousness, these characteristics are manifested as Fear, meaning the feeling,  which contracts, immobilizes and freezes man&rsquo;s every action:<br>

              The trap of fear carries us away  from the truth of our spiritual existence and pushes us deeper into the  delusion of earthly-material life. <strong><em>Our efforts are those of the ill-fortuned,</em></strong> because, usually, <strong><em>in fear and with suspicion, we fight to change the tides of fortune</em>, </strong>we try<strong> <em>to</em> <em>look out for the future  dangers</em>.</strong><br>
              <br>
              Unrest and fear for the future  colour the present with colours that do not exist in it and distort it. He, who <strong><em>wears  himself out</em></strong><em> <strong>planning</strong></em> the future, is used to transferring the essence of  happiness to the future, so that even if it materializes the way he envisages  it, when it becomes the present, he will postpone his happiness to a next  future. Some other time, anew, he pins himself to &quot;ideal&quot; situations - according to his own judgment -   which do not exist in his life now, and  in that way the present slips and passes without him bestowing the proper value  it is worthy of.<br>
              <br>
              In  this life there is no future &ndash; <strong><em>destiny has sudden twists and turns </em></strong>&ndash;  so, whoever <em><strong>wears himself out</strong></em> <strong><em>planning</em></strong> the future, toils in vain. We accumulate  possessions &ndash; <strong><em>the wealth, the exceptional, the superfluous wealth </em></strong>&ndash; with greed, because insecurity  completely possesses us, making the soul atrophy and the Temple of God remain empty. <br>

He knows within himself that immediate Providence  will present before him, whatever he needs, whenever he needs it.

              Fear, however, makes us <strong><em>intervene</em></strong> and <strong><em>interrupt </em></strong>that <strong><em>work of gods</em>. </strong>As <strong><em>hasty and inexperienced creatures of the  moment</em>,</strong> we easily lose touch with our self and we act  self-destructively. And whilst the mortal side of our self has by itself  pursued immortality, all of a sudden it becomes scared and interrupts the  procedure.

              Sometimes in life certain emotions are  so strong, that they manage to enforce their vibration and make our whole existence attune to them. &quot;My son, Dimofon, the stranger lets you perish in fire and me  go deep in sorrow!&quot; Metanira burst out. Then, we <strong><em>rush</em></strong> <strong><em>disheveled and terrified</em>, <em>with a troubled mind and terrified eyes </em></strong>and <strong><em>we  interrupt</em></strong> our course towards the Union.  Demeter answered her: &quot;You people are unwise. You foresee neither the future  good nor evil. And you, out of your irrationality, suffered incurable harm.  Immortal, who would remain eternally young, I would have made your beloved son  and I would have provided him with everlasting worship. Now, there is no other  way for him to avoid death.&quot; <br>
              <br>
In that way, the example of Thetis  and her <strong><em>Unfaithfulness</em></strong> represents many people, who interrupt the holy  procedure out of Fear and afterwards they ask themselves why the divine  prophecy has not been fulfilled.<br>

              <a name="la_pa_4"></a>The soul is that element of our  Self where the time-less and the non-space reside, hence it is expected that  through the soul's inner processing, man is able to investigate these planes  and receive the guidance he needs each time. Man is such a unity of elements,  which enables him to move in all planes, and being such a creature, each time he  must use the equivalent element, which &quot;unites&quot; him with some plane of the Universe.  In that way the soul, not the logic or the senses, is the one that functions as  a channel so that man &quot;finds&quot; himself in the dimension of the time-less and the  non-space, where he will get in touch with the equivalent dimension of His Self.  In other words, this is said by believers: &quot;prayer connects us with God&quot;. <br>
              <br>
And our soul is free to deliver  messages to us. What happened to Thetis happens unfortunately to people who  very often silence their soul and while, in that way, they make themselves  invalid, they consider they have become &quot;autonomous&quot; and &quot;masters of  themselves&quot;. The worst thing is that while they themselves choose to rely  exclusively upon the material side of their existence, they build their life on  it and from then on they blame God because, they say, He betrayed them! And  they do not realise that God is the Truth and the Truth can be none other than  the Truth and nothing different. That also is the meaning of faith: to  attribute to God all that belongs to Him.<br>
<br>
All that god Apollo had prophesied  for Achilles was the truth, because the Universe anticipates our return to Paradise. Goddess Thetis, however, who undertook to make  her son Achilles immortal, <strong><em>interrupted</em></strong> her own <strong><em>work</em></strong>,  by submitting to the fear of her mortal husband Peleus. Watching his son  sinking in the water, the father <strong><em>was fearful</em> <em>and intervened</em></strong>, believing, all the more so, that he &quot;saved  him&quot;. Besides, the same happened with Metanira: while in the first place she  herself had asked Demeter to make her son Dimofon immortal, she <strong><em>interrupted</em></strong> the process, out of fear, when she suddenly saw the goddess holding her child  over the fire. <br>
<br>
Peleus and Metanira <strong><em>tried  to avoid the certain danger that frightfully threatened them,</em></strong> but they  ended up with the opposite result: <strong><em>interrupting</em></strong> the <strong><em>good work</em> <em>the gods had initiated</em></strong>. In  reality, the danger not only was not certain, but was non-existent; because  what they saw was not what <em>really</em> existed. They were misled and acted in hot blood out of their partial perception  of the meaning of the circumstance, in other words, out of lack of trust in the  divine Plan.<br>
<br>
Fear is not a good counsellor; on  the contrary, it charges us with an accumulation of mistakes,
which finally  lead more certainly to the result which we wish to avoid.</p>
With the progress of experiences man learns to  apply a difficult but liberating inner discipline: when he is under the  influence of a specific emotion, he does not try to enforce it logically, but  he simply lets it exist without connecting it with rational thoughts. This  isolates the emotion and keeps it within the dimensions it really has. If we  fall into connecting the emotion with rational reasoning, then we consolidate  it on the one hand, and on the other we maintain the wrong association of ideas,  which distort reality. By learning to discipline the mind, we shall be able to suspend  every action and decision and connect  with our Self, each time the path is  not clear.
<p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a05"></a>5</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Whoever has learned to tune in to  the highest-divine frequency, realizes that there comes a time when the  illusion scatters &ndash; even the most convincing one &ndash; in which fear has misled him  innumerable times and  passes by, somehow or other, following determinism.  Evil is defined as the absence of positive properties and does not have a  self-existent thisness nor entity. The quality of Good always prevails and is  never threatened by Evil, which is usually none other than the negative  manifestation of the positive quality: just like the black colour which is actually  the absence of every quality of light &ndash; while the white is the highest quality  as the synthesis of all the manifestations of light. <br>
  <br>
So, Fear is an emotion, which ought  to be effaced from our hearts. Fear is a situation acquired by man and is exactly what is called the Fall  in the Old Scripture, since it is based only on the  creation of impressions and not on real causes. Inferior creatures &ndash; the serpent in the myth &ndash;  create illusions, plunge people in mental and  imaginary illusions, which in their turn lead to feelings of fear. Then man experiences a vibrational, energy  &quot;fall&quot;, which he inevitably &quot;pays for&quot; with pains and grief &ndash; since it  constitutes a loss of certain  positive-divine qualities of ours, and every loss is  painful. God supplies him with Faith, the  Serpent deceives him with fear.</p>
Elementals are on the look out to demolish anything  beautiful one builds with love and faith, because they envy the blessing of the  divine Seal, which they are not in a position to acquire. The feeling of fear  they managed to create in the son of the Sun, the &quot;bright&quot; <strong><em>Phaeton</em>,</strong> when he, in his desire  to meet the Light, tried to drive his father's chariot, resulted in him being killed.<br>

              The ground of fear is conducive to  the development of the feeling of <em>impatience</em> as well. <strong><em>We rush the journey</em>,</strong> as a result of our wrong perception of  Time and react with <strong><em>premature measures</em></strong>. What appears to be is not always what  actually exists. And this is an extra reason for not rushing to conclusions  because whatever seems to converge may be very far away, while whatever seems to  diverge may be very close.<br>

              When we become conscious of the  multi-faceted nature of time, we will become sure that living and  experiencing has a one-track course only externally, on the surface. The  motion of time in the direction that we perceive, is partial, that is why  the results of a judgment according to this dimension must also be limited.&nbsp; Consequently, we  must be able to wait, not with the usual meaning of the word, but the  more substantial one: the future in reality is the expanded present, and  therefore time does not move  in one direction but with the pattern in which  a wave expands in water, i.e. in all directions  circularly  around one starting point, which is the present.<br>
              <br>
              The sequence of the facts may at  first seem accidental, but in reality it is about one movement progressively  according to the flow of the expansion of the time &quot;wave&quot;, i.e. from the  centre to the outside. This movement of the conscience  makes it all the more  capable of understanding that, which a little while before it regarded as  inexplicable, because of the limited vision due to the circumstances.<br>
              <br>
              The  movement of time is regulated uniformly towards life, in limited space and our  course seems to be leading only in the direction of the future.  Consciousness, though, is not subject to limitations, like the sea that does not  have a direction. The return to the past, just like the transfer to the future, is a  shift simply to the periphery of the wave, temporary, nevertheless, and with a  limited conscience, since the centre always remains &quot;active&quot;  and immovable.<br>

              Every time man retreats from fear,  he connects in a one-sided way, i.e.  only with what he is scared of,  and this one-sided connection deprives him of a sensational reality. On the  contrary, when he connects with the centre of his existence, which experiences  moments of an eternal present, he lets time quickly fly ahead, condenses the future and is  automatically relieved of any painful connection.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a06"></a>6</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Fear keeps us transfixed to the  past. We carry the displeasing thoughts and images of the past to the  present, we hold the echo of our negative experiences alive, instead of simply  holding the extract of every experience as an outcome of knowledge within ourselves.  The truth, however, is that our life, goes ahead each moment, new and untouched by the past, unless we wish to colour it with its shadow.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
Because the past is the only period  of our life that we know, it seems natural and obvious to occupy ourselves with  it, returning mainly to its negative moments. The constant intellectual  preoccupation with the past may push  towards its repetition, and this happens  because the Universe is a huge photocopier: the human mind is the one  that moves the evolution of things, and the predetermined is none other than  the sequence on the way one chooses. Hence, as long as we continue to reproduce <strong><em>horrifying  memories</em></strong> and <strong><em>images from abominable times</em></strong> within  ourselves, we charge our aura negatively, creating the prerequisites for a  repetition of them.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Whenever, therefore, <strong><em>we are taken over</em></strong> <strong><em>by  bothersome</em> <em>thoughts</em> </strong>/<strong> <em>of our wayward life</em>, </strong>we must replace  them immediately with some other thought or activity and postpone their  conscious processing,  only for when and if we  feel we have  returned to the balanced state of inner harmony and tranquility.  <br>

              The past could teach us, because  mistakes are always repeated and cyclical, yet we face a situation each time as  if it were for the first time. Not only does &quot;History repeats itself&quot;, but also in our personal  life, we constantly trace recurring circles, we continually confront the same  problems until we find the absolute light we seek.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

            <p>When we observe that a problem  follows us in our life, reappearing in many sectors, this certainly does not  mean that someone wishes to make us suffer, or that the Universe functions with  feelings of sadism. On the contrary indeed: not solving it when it first  appeared, showed that we were not able and ready yet, so, the  &quot;circumstances&quot;, the external sheath of the problem, are modified,  in order to  retry under new conditions which may facilitate us more. At the same time, the  repeated appearance of the same problem under different patterns makes us  capable of recognizing it, even if it is elaborately disguised and enables us to become  familiar with it. Familiarization is always the first step that   fear, which &quot;freezes&quot; every reaction of the human being, be distanced.<br>
              <br>
              Evolution is an especially slow  procedure; that is why, even for the man who is conscious of his course and the  necessity of repetitions, it is inevitable that he will sometimes feel tired:<br>

              And while we often feel that we  move around the concentric circles which, after all, we ourselves design, most  of the time we do not see that the solution we seek is already in front of us  and, in fact, has  been put into practice many times and under more difficult circumstances.  We are a bit reminiscent of the man who was cured of a vision impairment and  every now and then its recollection makes him &quot;unable to see&quot;. Of course, such  a psychological phenomenon is not rare or curious; time is simply needed in order for  the soul  to be convinced that it has already found a way out. By  repeating the exercise it assures itself that it knows the solution. Studying  for school exams is also based on this very simple natural law, according to  earthly analogy; we solve and resolve the same mathematical exercise until  the certainty that we have understood is instilled  within ourselves, and we can automatically pull out the solution's mechanism, not only  for the same exercise but for a category of similar ones. The solution is found  the first time; the continuation is simply a process of learning by repetition.<br>
              <br>
A great deal of time is needed in order to  understand at a deeper level and put into practice, that which in the beginning  seems obvious or simple; many exercises are needed for Love to be conquered.<br>
<br>
It is suffice to imagine a man who  is bound by his instincts &ndash; so basically he functions through the second centre &ndash;  and suddenly life <strong><em>puts</em></strong> him <strong><em>in a port new for his eyes</em></strong> it brings  him before an experience of real love; then one of his higher energy centres  starts to radiate. Of course, the stimulation of a centre by some specific  experience is not enough  to speak of a conscious activation of this centre.  This kind of activation needs to be repeated many times in order for man to be  able to finalize the conscious functioning, <strong><em>with his self-earned right to be  a citizen of the city of ideas</em>, </strong>something which often requires many life  cycles with the equivalent experiences. <br>
<br>
When the consciousness is awakened  and man acquires consciousness of his fate, he fervently desires to walk with the  Light and the ascension of the <strong><em>very high stairway of Poetry</em>. </strong>While,  indeed, he becomes conscious of the <strong><em>many</em></strong><em> <strong>things he has to do outside</strong></em><strong>, </strong>he tries to go beyond the limits of  the earthly instant. He  forgets that time does not exist and what we, people, call &quot;sooner&quot; or &quot;later&quot; has no substantial meaning, that time is eternity and  the way is always the union with God. He forgets, as well, how long this way is  and that he must not expect from his self to embrace this knowledge so soon and  painlessly. In that way, instead of <strong><em>wishing for the road to be long</em>, </strong>it  is possible to fall into the pitfall of impatience and discouragement,  situations which delay him even more and steal his joy.<br>

              Man's life begins under particular  specifications, which he can however, modify, according to his will and his  developmental level. This modification does not usually refute the stages which man  must go through in the particular incarnation, but he can condense them as much  as possible and go on to new phases, which had not been foreseen for him from  the beginning. This, nevertheless, involves the following dangers: the  immoderate ambition, which is being fed and enforced the more man experiences  his &quot;successes&quot;, and the insufficient &quot;experiencing&quot; of the lessons.<br>
              <br>
              Both of them can destroy any  immature personality, no matter how pure and guileless the first intentions  were. In order to be gained, knowledge demands tireless experience of  repetitions,  the number of which is wiser to be decided by the Masters and not the disciples,  the coaches and not the athletes,  universal Providence and not the man.<br>
              <br>
              Each time our impatience &ndash; or, to  put it another way, our sincere desire &ndash; urges us to want to go on deeper  into the path of Initiation, let us consider that long strides do not  necessarily mean that someone will reach the target sooner; on the contrary,  rushed steps lead more surely to loss. Only he who<strong> <em>finds the way little by little,  </em></strong><em>/</em><strong><em> manages to reach the last line, </em></strong>having completely understood the  deeper meaning of &quot;more haste, less speed&quot;. <br>
              <br>
              As long as evolution progresses,  man escapes from any kind of attachments on a material level, something he cannot  do when and for however long  he is at lower levels. This sense of trust in immediate Providence can become  conscious only when man has entered the path, and this constitutes a determinant  feature of this phase. Consequently, as long as he materializes this trust by  executing, even the most painful exercises, without complaining, despite <strong><em>the  many hardships</em> <em>he finds on the way</em>,</strong> he consolidates his course and his choice on the path of  divine Initiation. </p>
