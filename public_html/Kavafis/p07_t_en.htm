Fate is our subconscious guidance  from the universal forces &ndash; our Masters and guides &ndash; towards necessary and  indispensable experiences so as to learn how to  make decisions,  support  our  desires and our self, because our self is the total sum of our desires.<br>
              <br>
As long as man is subject to this compulsory  guidance, he faces the lack of happiness as a situation, which he ought to bear  until &quot;fate&quot; brings him a change. On the contrary, for the man that walks the  path, lack of happiness means that he has to act immediately in order to  restore  balance. Man must ask, because only in that way can he activate the  movement of the Forces towards him. As long as he does not ask, the Universe  sends him only that which indirectly concerns him, but have been put into motion by  other forces, that is to say he receives only impersonal results and not  personal.<br>
<br>
Man will spend a great part of his  course in the fatalistic drift &ndash; <strong><em>he will wait, he will be worn down </em></strong>and<strong><em> he  will be bored </em></strong>&ndash; without realizing that only if he  recognizes and fulfils his real desire every time, will he be able to be guided  to the happiness of Love and Union. The <strong><em>student of Ammonius Saccas </em></strong> also walks <strong><em>the  arduous way </em></strong>along which <strong><em>men fumble in a dark paradise</em>.</strong> The  diagram of his life is characteristic:<br>

              We should remember that everything impinges on man's free will and nobody, no matter how high standing he may be,  can violate this Principle and move towards a person who has not asked for any  such thing. Besides, only through this process, which constitutes a process of  realizing the Unity and the Total Functioning and Co-operation, can man become  capable of realizing the responsibility he shares in the Work of God's Plan and reap  the fruits of the teachings and experiences which are necessary for him. </p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a24"></a>24</strong></span><strong>. </strong> When man has become fatalistically  complacent, he will meet external factors in his life, which will deliberately  make things hard for him, seemingly blind alleys, big surprises and twists and  turns. The universe will send a series of trials in order to guide man into  undertaking the responsibility and joy of his choices, since only in that way  will he become free and complete. <em>Freedom</em> is experienced when man manages to assure for himself the decision for the  situations he lives. This is always feasible, even when it seems that nothing  is in his jurisdiction. The knowing man also assumes responsibility for the  very fact of his reappearance on earth, as he does for the moment of his  departure. As for <em>completeness</em>, this  comes in our life and in our task when we ourselves decide the flow of the  existence of things.<br>
  <br>
  A Syrian of the 2nd  century BC symbolizes with his attitude to life, man, everywhere and forever,  who is at the initial stages of evolution and  hence will inevitably meet what &quot;fate&quot; sends him, calling him to love his self  and life.<br>

              Afterwards, he examines the only  three choices he thinks he has, and his decision is a chance result, given that  none satisfies him, but he thinks:<br> 
            </p>
            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">
              <tr>
                <td><p><strong><em>And my conscience is clear</em></strong><br>
                    <strong><em>for the  recklessness of the choice.</em></strong><br>
                    <strong><em>All three of them harm Syria just the same.</em></strong></p>
                  <p><strong><em>But, a ruined  man, <u>how am I to blame</u>.</em></strong><br>
                  <strong><em>I, the wretched  one, ask to get by.</em></strong></p>                </td>

            <p>As it also happened with this <em>&quot;</em><strong><em>wretched</em></strong><em>&quot;</em> man, we usually receive the results of our choices during the present  incarnation, in order to realize how interrelated everything is and to advance.  God knows exactly what we want. What must be done is that we ourselves come to know what we are  asking for, and this is the reason for the materialization of some thoughts in  an immediate time span; as well as   to try out the consequences our will may  effectuate in some direction. <br>
              <br>
But it is also a fact that we are not  to &quot;blame&quot; for many of the things that happen to us in life, at least not as  far as we can remember or interpret from the facts of the present incarnation.  It is not possible to entrench the conception of Truth into our own data,  neither can we always fully understand the function that  is taking place in our life. The trials, to which people are submitted, do not  receive sufficient and precise interpretation, because this would mean  revelations which they would not be able to perceive. A mother, for instance,  is tested many times before she becomes capable of attracting a strong soul on  the earthly plane, which she knew when she chose to return, but this is known  to her only subconsciously, by &quot;instinct&quot; as we say.<br>
<br>
Moreover, when people are found to  be under the influence of a strong emotional charge, they are not in the  position to realize that the strictness of the universe does not derive from  superiority, but from love and prompting for the better. It is a presence of  love and understanding, and aims to set man's movements in such a way, that  he becomes capable of gaining whatever he seeks; in other words, it is care and love  for the chosen ones. In some cases, this strictness even seems disproportionate  to man's action in order to prevent, even his potential fall. The universe does  not want to scare us; it wants to awaken us from the nightmare, the awakening is simply unpleasant. <br>
<br>
Again at other times, man goes  through particularly powerful experiences, because he has chosen to exhaust the  existing possibilities, which are indeed very great,  to condense the necessary  experiences, in order to advance to a subsequent stage of development, a choice which  he may not remember. This certainly explains many of the &quot;injustices&quot; people  consider happening in a man's life.</p>
            <p>What man encounters in his life, in the course  of self-fulfillment, is not only what he &quot;deserves&quot;, but also some things he needs to encounter   for other reasons, just as for instance, in order to know them when it is  necessary, some time afterwards, to pass on to other people; or because his  karma connects with the karma of people who are on another course and this has  an indirect influence on his own life; or, even, because he has chosen it  himself indirectly, when he chose other elements &ndash; for example, someone who has  chosen to be born a pioneer of an Art and inevitably faces the rejection of his  contemporaries as well. For this man, trials have a completely different  character, since he knows the purpose they serve for the Plan almost  simultaneously. Therefore, the situations we are facing do not constitute an  efficient criterion for us to evaluate our self.<br> 
            </p>
            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">

                <td><p><strong><em>Let the  frivolous call me frivolous.</em></strong><br>
                    <strong><em>In serious  matters I have always been</em></strong><br>
                    <strong><em> most diligent. (&hellip;)<br>
                    </em></strong><strong><em>This correctness,  probably, is the cause of the blame.</em></strong></p>

            <p><br>
              In every case, though, the fact  that we are not to &quot;blame&quot; for something, does not retract our responsibility to handle it correctly. And the correct handling is not as if we were reacting,  but as if we were acting initially. Countless similar experiences will come with  the aim of our realizing that what we have to do is to act and not re-act. This  happens in order to examine the motives of an action honestly, without trying  to hide ourselves not even from ourselves. If our intention is sincere and  pure, this means that we will act in the same way regardless of what the others are  doing or did, because this will be determined by our own principles.<br>
              <br>
And the <strong><em>ruined man</em></strong> who &quot;isn't to  blame&quot; and that is why he has <strong><em>his conscience clear</em></strong> for <strong><em>the  recklessness of the choice</em>,</strong> ends up asking for the solution from the  &quot;gods&quot;, transferring the responsibility to them:<br> 
            </p>
            <table  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="myArial2">
              <tr>
                <td><p><strong><em>The mighty gods</em></strong><em> <strong><u>should have cared</u></strong></em><br>
                  <strong><em>to create a  fourth good one.</em></strong><br>

            <p>Often, we people ask to be given  things, which we have not earned and that is why they do not come. And then we  do not concern ourselves with earning them, but with asking for them: we become  beggars instead of becoming workers, indeed without even realizing it.<br>
              <br>
              It is important to understand that  we must not ask, because nobody else has the power of activation other than  our self, who encompasses Everything, therefore lack is unfounded and in reality  it is a flight from Work. In other words, when we ask it means that we do not  experience the Now, and experiencing is the course of the Soul. When we  identify with the non-Now we nullify ourselves, and that is why we feel the  solitude and pain of separativeness. That was the <em>primary pain</em> the &quot;first&quot; people of Mythology felt, when they  desired the non-Now, what they did not have, meaning when they denied  the Course of Experiencing, which God initiated by dividing his Self in order to  become conscious of It, when they were placed outside the Work. Flight from  the Now, consequently, may only inflict pain on man, because it reminds him  of his separation from the One, from God.<br>
              <br>
              Everything exists from within  Conscience, and what we do not define does not exist. When God named his  Creations, he then gave them life, because the name, the Word is the  manifestation of the divine, the materialization of his Will. In that sense,  when we ask, then we cannot have, because only by naming a lack, we immediately  give it material dimensions for realization in earthly life. Hence, what is a paradox  for us is explained; acquiring something when we stop seeking it, because then  we cease giving substance to its absence.<br>
              <br>
              Desire has the meaning of choice  and differentiates from the sense of lack, which entails requesting.  Asking implies  that you do not have &ndash; absence &ndash; whereas desiring implies that you choose to  direct your attention to one of All, the partial  of the Whole.</p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a25"></a>25</strong></span><strong>. </strong>Man's future is determined by his  desires. These are pre-decided, even before the soul acquires earthly  dimensions. The course towards their fulfillment is not predetermined, what we  people call &quot;future&quot; does not pre-exist as energy. What pre-exists, though, is the power that will urge man  towards some specific ways and the ways that lead to the specific  result are known. This power is will, desire, and under this context, man's  &quot;future&quot; can be detected in his present. (This is what astrology can  foresee, when the stars, during the moment of arrival in this time-space  dimension, describe the desires of the soul that is arriving).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  Therefore, whatever we have a premonition  about,  is whatever we desire, as eternal and imperishable souls and  the driving force of universal Creativity directs our life towards it. If our  level is subject to forces that we do not control, then we are not &quot;free&quot; (as  far as the earthly consciousness  is concerned) to choose our way. Then, as we mentioned before, we are subject to  specific guidance and we are unaware of the Universe&rsquo;s influences. The more we evolve, however,  choices are left to our own initiative, since we  are from then on capable of clearly seeing the results of our choices. This  immediacy does not mean that we have been abandoned in a course without  guidance, but that we can from then on come in contact with the initial plan  that has been drawn up for our present life and participate actively in it.  Then our desires and our wishes are immediately fulfilled and we can direct the  situation without the help of &quot;fate&quot;, which is none other than the  subconscious guidance of those who are found at a lower level of development.<br>
  <br>
  The  capability of choosing the way &ndash; the &quot;future&quot; &ndash; is given theoretically, but because the knower-man is by definition in accordance with his  initial desires, in  practice it leads him to a life that converges with the predetermined tendencies.  This is naturally a result of a decision and not a fatalistic letting go, because  in this second case, surprises are shocking: sometimes it is  more important for  man's responsibility and creativity to be awakened rather than the initial life  plan to be followed. This twist may derive either from the surrounding  circumstances, when man has fatalistically contented himself, in order to &quot;make&quot; him again realize  the necessity to assume  responsibility that characterizes him archetypically, or it derives from man himself,  when he experiments with how much he can influence things. After he makes sure,  from then on he goes along with the initial plan willingly. Going along with it can  not be carried out while man has even the slightest doubt about the degree of his  influence and the extent of his will's enforcement on matters.<br>
  <br>
  Responsibility  devolves  exclusively upon the specific entity concerning the path it follows. We can liken it to an  actor who is free to choose the part he wants, but after his choice he is  &quot;bound&quot; by the specific script, at least as far as the external, the shape-like  part is concerned. Because, the interpretation, the internal part, is what he  will offer, his personal presentation, the work he will release for the World.<br>
  <br>
  The transformation of energy, that  man performs in the World, is exactly this &quot;interpretation of a role&quot;, the  manifestation of uniqueness along predetermined roads. He, who manages to  distinguish the capacity for creation, personal and free, from within patterns  externally rigid and determined,  will be the one who became capable of expressing  God in the World.</p>

              We are called, therefore, to become aware of the weight of the choice. Fear is the reverse force of repressing creation, by  suspending choice, which is the propulsive force of life. In that way fear  specifies the power of death. Death is the situation of the deadened stagnation  when the ability of choice, which continues Life, has been weakened. So,  there exist no wrong or right choices: the assumption of the responsibility of  each road leads to life, to the preservation of the Universe's Eternal  Movement. That is why it is necessary to chase away fear, that holds us  prisoners, and advance in the road of Life, with courageous decisions that lead  to motion. See to our own interpretation, our own creation: to lay down  our interpretation in every new role of life without  models which  determine the alleged right or wrong, because right and wrong do not exist.  There exists the uniqueness that is  expressed through every being.<br>
              <br>
Man has the capacity to process  internally, to work with persistence, but although this work may be action, it  cannot overthrow Laws and Supreme Procedures relative to him. In practice this  means that he can and must be called into action dynamically, to move in space,  to exhaust creative thinking, to seek, to desire and to experience, knowing at  the same time that all this does not relate directly to the final manifestation  of every situation. Namely, pertaining to himself, he must act, so that he should realize and control anything that happens (to  him), but pertaining to the result, he should trust the Forces which  function above and beyond his limited earthly consciousness.<br>
<br>
According to earthly analogy, the  good parent prepares his child to start its life as well as possible, and tries  to foresee as many pitfalls as he can. Then he frees his child and trusts the  work he has done up until then. This happens with every kind of &quot;child&quot;, meaning  man's creation, material or immaterial. The good parent does not continue to  long for control forever, because then both he and his Son remain captives, and  he impedes the operation of the Laws. This naturally happens in the spiritual  plane as well, when people, with their  limited earthly consciousness, insist on wanting to direct the situations themselves,  towards the specific result,  which they consider partially as right.</p>
Let us work, therefore, with devotion and steady  will, but let us entrust our &quot;child&quot; to the World.

Anyway, the result  does not  exist, at least as far as we, being inside the form of life, can judge. No  matter how much we  postpone  the judgment of the result  of an action of ours into the future, when the time comes for the future to become present, the  &quot;result&quot; will escape us, because it will again be a fleeting moment in  progress. The future will always be ahead for as long as earthly life lasts, and as  far as the future expands no result can be judged conclusively. So, let  us not struggle and let us not agonize over the result. Life  is constant motion, where we should advance by following desire and not  teleological aims. &quot;Take therefore no thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall  take thought for the things of itself&quot; (Mathew 6:34).<br>

              When man ceases  identifying with the result, he realizes the real destination of his work,  which is to become <strong><em>just, wise, brave</em> </strong>/<strong> <em>and even the  best of all, Greek</em></strong>: he has, therefore, only  to examine, after every  ordeal and regardless of the outcome of a situation, if he ensured a  step in the direction of the inner <strong><em>attributes</em></strong> which he nurtures. This  is the work of incarnated man and on this he ought to focus; <strong><em>those  beyond are found with the gods.</em></strong></p>
            <p><span class="style8"><strong><a name="a26"></a>26</strong></span><strong>. </strong>He, who lives without expecting the  tangible results of his actions in this dimension to give him the real  dimensions of the events, but simply follows his path, without trying to judge  from the facts or the results, he is the one who has essentially defeated <em>stagnation</em>.<br>
              <br>
We people ought to understand the  necessity of change and not insist on consolidating psychological states or  external ones, because this opposes the flow of universal energy, which  is none other than difference of potential. Just like difference of potential in  Physics is responsible for the flow of electric current, likewise in  Meta-physics it leads to the motion of cosmic energies.</p>
We people often have the desire to stop life and  we confuse this stopping with Eternity: we wish to continue having something  unchangeably and irrevocably for Ever and Ever or be in some way forever &ndash; as  it seems to us that we are satisfied &ndash; and we do not understand that the Laws  of Eternity are far from related to stagnation. On the other hand, a situation  that satisfies us under given circumstances will not continue to be judged the  same under other circumstances &ndash; unless we are ambitious to stop the whole  Universe! &ndash; and something like that is certainly identified with death. Beyond  every change, though, there exists exactly the same situation of Supreme  Tranquility, which throughout every motion ensures the sense of the One,  the Eternal, the Timeless.<br>
<br>

<p><strong><em>And things can not and must  not be everlasting, because man would then be </em></strong><em>&quot;</em><strong><em>stiff</em></strong><em>&quot;</em><strong><em> and would stagnate in  emotional inertia, due to lack of change.<br>
    </em></strong> </p>
            <p>In our effort to go along with the eternal Principles, we must be ambitious not to maintain happiness &ndash;  as a feeling &ndash; for ever, because something like that, apart from unfeasible, is  futile and harmful since it means immobility=death, but the certainty of disidentification  with any feeling, to experience them with a-pathy* - being the final desire, on  an essential level.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="notes">(* Both in ancient and modern  Greek, the word &quot;a-pathy&quot;, consists of the prefix &quot;a&quot;, that means no, and the  word &quot;pathos&quot;, which means &quot;passion&quot; and is used positively.) </span></p>
            <p>Furthermore, people think that  what is realized every moment of our life, is the only existing thing. We are  unaware, though, that irrelevant to whether we materialize one facet in the  specific moment, we ourselves are <em>all  facets</em>, and naturally we can materialize another facet. The problem with linear  time is that the facets are manifested linearly, meaning successively and not  simultaneously, holistically. This perception makes us identify with every  phase and not expand ourselves mentally to the understanding of the flow,  which anyway constitutes  a law of general life, for instance the  succession of day and night, of the seasons, etc. It is as if someone stops the  projection of a movie and stays in the frozen frame.<br>
              <br>
              In life, the movie is determined by  us. We must simply choose the shots, the frames we wish, and &quot;run&quot; them: then  we will be living the script we have chosen.</p>

              We must be ready to resign from  every emotional attachment, because we shall never manage to be happy and truly  promised to life, as long as even one shadow of the fear of loss exists.<br>
              <br>
              He, who is not capable of losing,  is not capable of having.<br>

Besides, each time man <strong><em>bids  farewell to the Alexandria he is losing</em>,</strong> there always comes a <strong><em>secret  company</em></strong> to call him <strong><em>with exquisite music, with voices</em></strong> to <strong><em>another  city</em></strong>, a <strong><em>new land</em></strong>. God did not <strong><em>forsake Anthony</em>,</strong> He protected him as  much as He protects all people, and even every creature of Creation, no matter  how insignificant it may seem. Because the tree does not sprout without soil,  the house is not built without stone. Man has the feeling that <strong><em>God  forsakes him</em></strong>, each time he lets the fear of loss conquer him.<br>

            <p>The man who has leveled   selfishness &ndash; <strong><em>a great soul he has</em></strong> &ndash; wipes fear and needs out of his mind,   is assured of  divine Providence and then he will see the dark tunnel coming to  its end. And every time life calls upon him to a new role, he forgets everything that  distorts the essence of spiritual exercise, everything that moves beyond the truth, he  is completely cut off from every insecurity that has to do with earthly  adversities, <strong><em>changes costume and departs</em>.</strong><br>
              <br>
Because only then do we not <strong><em>interrupt the work of gods</em></strong><em>:</em> when we  let things be led to where they are destined, without our own mental or  emotional interference; in other words we believe in our Self and we let it  show us the way. Our Self is <strong><em>the Gods</em></strong>, who <strong><em>always come to bring some order </em></strong>and  when<strong> <em>this  perfection of theirs demolishes our futile work</em></strong><em>,</em> this happens in order  to help us find the way again, which will bring us to our predetermined task.<br>
<br>
We then realize that behind all that  is happening in our life, there is the Providence of divine Thinking, which  prepares the coming of the New, spiritual and awakened Life within ourselves. The  traces of pain vanish, because pain is caused when we feel vulnerable, weak and  powerless against  evil, meaning when we forget that the Power is on our  side in every movement, in every step.<br>
<br>
Not the <strong><em>bitter lament for the futility of  everything</em>, <em>that very ancient  complaint of the suffering man, </em></strong><em>&quot;</em><strong><em>all lies, all shadows</em></strong><em>&quot;</em><strong>,</strong> but <strong><em>the  brave lament, full of love and full of sparkle</em></strong> is the one that brings  redemption. When the sun sets, we <em>(in  Greek)</em> say it &quot;reigns&quot; and when man experiences pain, he gains the kingdom  of Heaven. <br>

              When <strong><em>our every hour hurts</em>, </strong>if  we listen to our heart, it will tell us that this pain is the birth of a new  life, is the meaning you do not find, wherever else you may search. Pain is the  blessing of new life, of Birth, of Creation. However much  we may suffer, our  heart knows that pain will be nothing but a faint memory when the miracle of  New Life has been configured into our life. And the miracle is put into motion by love, that which is not subjugated by fears or commands of emulation. <br>
              <br>
Let us train our love like a real  child, let us consolidate it, let us make it strong, and when it resides within ourself, then God will reside with it as well. The Light of love will, for good and  all, disrupt <strong><em>the long tedium, which surrounded his </em></strong>(man's)<strong><em> spirit with a thick fog </em></strong>when<strong> <em>he had concluded</em></strong><em>:</em><strong><em> each hour of mine wounds;  the final one slays</em>,</strong> and will lead him to the insight:</p>
