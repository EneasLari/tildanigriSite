How many tempests does it take for you to arrive at the point of clearing up situations and needs which you had thought  were supreme and  everlasting ... how much effort, how much pain, how much anguish in order to see  an otherwise simple fact as an illusion ... how many lives in order to become  able to locate the illusion of the "great", of the "important" ...</p>
          <div align="justify">You know, honey, my life has taken an abstract form  ... I think I have pinpointed it lately. In fact, lately, in general, I conceive   notions in a different way. Whenever I think of a problem, I rarely  consider it mine. I observe everything as if they were temporary situations  and catch myself being calm, almost unemotional, participating from a distance.  Surely, deep inside, we know that this is how things are, but my attitude still  startles me ...</div></td>
