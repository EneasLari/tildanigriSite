The "but" is the mind, the &quot;I love&quot; is understanding ... It is  there that you set yourself free, you admit, you obey! <br>

          <div align="justify">For us the verb understand applies. This is our job. We get there with  His help! You don't need to agree in order to understand ... Understanding comes  through what you don't approve of. Love does not need agreement of opinions. Try  your love with your opposite ... Your like is you. We got  here  because we brought a ready package to go, so let's not get too excited ... the others have their own path, their own package, it is not their  fault that we thought otherwise for them ... They are revealing their own truth  now, so why should we get angry? Who deluded whom?          </div>          </td>

There is always help for them and us as  well. It is just that we by knowing certain things, feel we have been done an injustice ... which  by no means is true, because He gave us everything ... it's time we dealt with  ourselves and let the others go their way, because by setting them free, we get  rid of our own chains as well. Only in this way and by blessing them, will the  "spell" be broken ... <br>
        </p>
          <div align="justify">The difficult path is  for those who understand. However, consider how  tough it is for them, who live close to people like us ... We are not diminished,  we simply go along with them without making them feel small. This is the  best way for them to distinguish the difference. Our example, without many  words and theories, will teach them to walk. These are words coming from the  soul, everything else is what we were taught to use and don't need anymore.  It's time for reality. No more insidious emotions and anger for other people's  disabilities. We remove even the slightest remnant of the lie from ourselves ...</div></td>
