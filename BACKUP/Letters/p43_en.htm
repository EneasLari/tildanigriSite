I'm indeed pleased about it and I gain value ... And then,  I become the way I imagined myself, I have another look, another consciousness,  another perception: A single, unique piece, with thousands of variations, without  destination, without ending or beginning. ONE piece, which manifests whatever it  wants to try, to taste, to understand ...</p>

      <tr>
        <td colspan="2" valign="top" class="style5"><p align="justify">And how strange, it  has the naivety to consider everything it sees as different, it thinks that everything it feels  has a meaning only for it ... Delusion and naivety, but only in this way does it end  up at the truth of the like. "God made man in his own image". How did this  come to me now? What am I, if not His reflection? His incomplete version, yet struggling  to reach the original ... one of His infinite forms, struggling to reach His  image. A minimum side of His, without name and identity until my return to Him  ... How can I exist without His shadow? How can I live without His acceptance?<br>
              <br>
          All the time I wander around His haunts, all my moments bear His conscience! When I  think that I have emptied my mind, it's that I remember Him. When I believe my  heart stops, it's that it beats at His pace! Where is solitude then, that has  become a nightmare for everybody? Where is insecurity then, that derives only from  the world we live and move?<br>
          <br>
          How strange really that we must change the way we function and our habits in  order to meet Him! Only through what they kept us away from, He exists ... only  in what we avoided, He exists. How can you prove that you ARE when the other  isn't aware that he IS? How can you teach him to see when he doesn't know which  eyes to use? Patience until the blessed moment of the same vision arrives,  until the blessed hour of the same image comes ... of His image, your image, my  image.</p>
          <div align="justify">A shelter is His love, a port is the understanding  of His teaching. In everything He exists, from everything He gets His share, He  blesses everything, He guides everything! Only one feeling undercuts what we  know intuitively: fear! A thorn of disorientation ... fear, the only reason for  growing away from His target!        </div>          </td>
